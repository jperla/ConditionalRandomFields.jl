I am at work and I'm NOT bored
It looks like we might get out at a decent hour
If I do I'll call you
Were you ever able to find a parking space for me
No I can't make it this weekend
Are you making the trip
Here is a copy of my resume
If you need any other information please let me know
I have attached the Request Form
Please email the form back to me
I don't know why I'm sleepy
I got more than an hour's sleep
I definitely want them
How long did it take you to get up the elevator
I made it in before the crowd backed up
She didn't seem too excited about it either
If you don't understand I am sure you can figure it out
I am writing this from my apt
I just got back from your place
Could you send the the procedures you wrote for this job
I wish I had left
Why did he call you
That should tell you how my day's going
I'll see you for lunch
I don't know who this chick is down here but Rock is telling her about the Bench
I don't think I can stay quiet much longer
That'll save me a lot of time
How I have no idea
I had already rolled everything
All he had to do was query and calc it
Yeah I know...I'm a grown woman I don't you telling me what to do
I just completely forgot about it this weekend
I meant to drop it off Sat
It's just a matter of actually making myself go do it
Call me when you get out of French
I'll probably still be packing so you can stop by and visit
I was just thinking about emailing you...no I really was
It's scary we think alike
I can't believe I'm leaving tomorrow
I have soooooo much to do today
Do you have French
That would be such a shame if you couldn't go
You might just have to come with me again
What website did you find that cruise on
Was it hard for you
I feel like my whole body is swollen
I'll just have to stay here all by myself
If we go to lunch today it'll have to be kind of quick
You have a real problem sending messages to the wrong people don't you
I dropped it off on my way this morning
Are you awake
Are you just hanging around waiting on me
And I thought you were a nice guy
Boy was I wrong
It's not exactly career enhancing to make your boss wait
What you talking about Willis
I thought you were in Chicago
If I had a car I'd drive into town and explore a bit
He said it was pretty bad there
I know I know you haven't heard from me either
I wanted to check in and see how you're doing
He's actually doing really well considering he had major surgery
I think he expected to be running marathons by now
Well I have to work a double shift to cover for someone all but one week this month
So that's pretty much all I have time to do now
Let me know how you're doing when you get a chance
I know she's the best risk person we have but give me a break
I adjusted McKay and Lambie's positions so they should be correct now
Let me know if we are still off
If you have any questions give me a call
I always said I didn't care
This is the time when you regret that but anyways
I first thought of just going to dinner then I thought of maybe doing something else
Now I don't know anything
Why do you need to know if we do something else
Do you worry you might go to bed a little late
So are you thinking going to dinner or something else
I work with a guy in our Chicago office
You know you can buy disposable cameras at most stores
Wish I had thought to bring a camera
The temperature when I landed was ZERO degrees
What a complete waste of my time
I passed though
Can you imagine failing and having to take it again?
If I'd known that I would have finished it yesterday
Have you decided what you want to do tonight
I'll give you a birthday call later
I am waiting for a more personal Happy Birthday call
What time did you get out of here yesterday
I'll tell you later
I can't imagine what she'd be doing with him
I don't know why
I had to look for something in my sent mail earlier
At least half if not more of the emails I send are to you
I didn't make it to the final test
So I only wasted two hours of my life this afternoon
I still have one section left
Otherwise I'll finish it tomorrow at lunch
So it's not safe to ride with me yet
Not that my car ever really leaves the Enron garage
I probably have you more excited than you should be now
What time do you think you'll get out of here tonight
We are tired of it
I am also tired of looking at it
Did you start watching Defensive Driving
What do you mean you almost got busted
Just hoping I guess
Maybe you'll make it back by Easter
Good luck with your trip
Sorry we won't get to see you for Christmas
Hope you like Chicago
I had a blast over there
And what am I supposed to do once I'm there
What use would I have for a wool coat down here
I'm going to freeze my tushy off
You know I love Fajitas from there
What made you think I did not like Lupe's
Have got some good gossip but I almost got busted a minute ago so you're gonna have to wait
I am now responsible for publishing the EES Gas Position Report
Did you get caught sneaking in late
I don't think anyone knew I was gone
I'll go whenever you want
They have no political voice and the machines are old give me a break
Oh my goodness cry me a river
Don't send me any more of this crap today
I'm trying to enjoy my Friday
I think I told you that already
You're making me miss you already
I definitely have time
Give me a call when you want to go
Do you have time
I did finish but it was funny the way I finished it
Did you finish on time
Most of the time we meet these deadlines
If you rather I didn't wait let me know
Here are my accomplishment
Let me know if you need anything else before tomorrow afternoon
Is it time to go home yet
I still haven't finished my accomplishments
I want out of the building
Goss thought it was hilarious
I haven't gotten anywhere on my accomplishments
I'm still hoping I can come to your game though
How do you come up with all this
Did someone teach you how to write accomplishments
I hadn't thought about integrating my goals into my accomplishments
And you consider me an overachiever
How did you start your accomplishments
I know what you meant in your earlier email
Maybe I could even come watch you play soccer
But all that hinges on my accomplishments
And of course since I put it off until today we violated every limit we have this morning
Well we didn't violate p&l just VAR and positions
See you at lunch
Do you think they'll let him/her get in
I think this is it
I can't believe it...I just saw Phillip Allen laugh
Shocking isn't it
Of course I remember
I have a great Spanish teacher
Do you want to go to the brown bag tomorrow
Gossett officially asked me for my accomplishments today
I have to have them done by tomorrow night
And as for the admitting in front of other people I did tell you about this
No mention of you or Austin
Was she mad at you
You really want to leave badly don't you
I don't think I have anything you can do though
What you talkin' bout Willis
I went home and took a little nap
But to answer your question yeah I'm ready to go
I probably shouldn't leave but I'm definitely ready
You don't have me beat
We have them delivered at least a couple times a year
Not that I have any great ideas but I'm hoping I can find her some clothes
If all else fails I'll get her blue earrings
Are you watching CNN right now
I also like the Sore Loserman signs
Enjoy a doughnut for me
Besides you have the whole weekend to look forward to
I am looking forward to picking on you
This is my last week in Houston
If your free for lunch sometime this week let me know
Today is my favorite day of the month...we're rolling everything today
Let me rephrase that I'M rolling everything tonight
Knowing how things are down there you might just be starting your day
You didn't expect me to be awake in Spanish did you
I just might have that movie
By AAANNYYY coincidence would you happen to have that movie
Thank you for returning my call
Therefore I did not submit an eRequest
Here is the P&L breakout you requested
My morning was great...no problems everything nice and quiet the way I like it
Now I know who you are talking about
Isn't she annoying
Well more and more I realize that my stress is all my boss' fault
Anyways I think I just need to learn how to work with my new boss
I need to come up with my own assumptions
She's driving me nuts
That and the fact that I had a long meeting this morning with your other buddy Chris Disable
I thought Bilal was still looking at the Enovate books
Lets talk about it before we add these books
Your User ID is enronrobin and your password is amerex
Interesting though isn't it
I think we're going to Lupe's
You are invited if you want to come
Anyways just wanted to let you know
I thought about you this weekend
I was going to bring you some but there weren't even crums left
Well I just wanted to brag
So I'll leave you alone
By the way how was your trip to Kinder
Did you have trouble finding the hotel or resturant
I'm glad to know he thinks you are worth something
Yeah I was way too excited to sleep last night
Oh here a highlight for your day
I forgot Binh has today off too
She won't be back until tomorrow so I have another two shift day...YUCK
Are we having Spanish class today
I am sorry you did not get much sleep
He still thinks I am worth something
I am being subdued right now
And no I didn't get much sleep last night but it wasn't really your fault
Even after I went to bed I just kept waking up
I feel a little dazed but other than that I'm okay
Just kidding thank you very much anyways
I felt bad I left really late last night
I hope you got some good rest
Glad you are back at work
Go Home and get some sleep so you can drive tomorrow
I can go home now
Well let me know if you need to do anything before we leave tomorrow
I can actually help you since I am pretty much done
Are you thinking that there's a problem with Canada's position
Call me if any questions
Therefore I already have access to the VAR information
Also please let me know what trader is responsible for this position
Per Bilal they need to be done today
Can you further break it out by intramonth and term
Are you still using the FTCD file
If you are please let me know to what trader to assign the P&L
I spoke with Bilal
On Monday Bilal will give you a detail breakout of the deadline for Canada
Regarding the the Canadian P&L report I left a message for Gillis to get the numbers out there
Hope this gives you an idea of our progress
I took care of the Executive Viewer
I left a message for Kathy to call me
I think you have me confused with someone else
And as for my family and friends if you think you can stand them you're welcome to come along
So you were serious about it
I really appreciate that you still keep me in mind and I apologize for not having told you anything
I am sure you probably need to know to plan ahead
Have you thought any more about coming with me for Thanksgiving
I spent the most of the morning Wed on evaluations
Some I had to think about a little harder than others
It all depends on how many comments you write
I'd love to see your shirt
I just need to plan ahead
Sounds like you have a wild night planned
I don't think I'm up to that kind of partying tonight
I've actually finished the evaluations but I haven't submitted them yet
How late were you here last night
How did everything turn out with your boss yesterday
I am going to bring popcorn and a good CD
Robin - I have already added your name to my list
When you have finished please return the file to me
OTHERWISE MY ATTORNEY THINKS I HAVE A VERY GOOD CASE AND I'LL SEE YOUR ASS IN COURT
I ALSO VOTED IN PALM BEACH COUNTY
What do you mean you're bidding for a company
Are you writing the bid for your boss
And why would you be complaining
What are you confused about
You mean you actually got to leave the building...wow
Sorry it took me so long to reply we had a slight crisis here
I couldn't send myself a net send
Try sending yourself a message to see what happens
Have you kept up with any new information about Risk people
You know what I mean right
Glad it worked now maybe you won't get fired
Have you gotten something to eat yet
I finally just built an EES report in the Basis report
This will get me brownie points right
Please note my new location
Please let me have this information as quickly as possible
I really wish you were here right now
Unfortunately that isn't nearly the most irritating thing that he does
I'll update you as he provides me with more stories
It's a lot more popular there than it is here
And they eat meat pies...yuck
I saw quite a few good looking guys
I do have specific questions about Australia though
What do they eat
What did you eat
Did you make them speak just to hear the accent
Did they make you speak just to hear your accent
Megan enjoyed your email message
I just had a couple more miles
I can walk this morning but my legs are fatigued
Too bad you can't see and hear me moan
I'll just write it a couple of times
You know I think Ann is going to Michigan so it'll just be me
Maybe I'll just stay home and stuff my face
I sure do love that kid
I have attached the move request below
What do we need to change to correct that problem
If you need any more information let me know
Do you know anything about the Congress Plaza Hotel
Relative to most of the questions I answer all day your questions don't even count as stupid
B PS How many stupid questions do you get every day
Did you have something good today
What should I give up for lent
I couldn't open this
Sending any of this will get you dropped off the list
I need another vacation
I never told you about my trip did I
The crowd was soooo wild...that is until we won
And I got to see Cathy Freeman and Marion Jones run
Oh here's a funny story for you
I was on a boat full of grandpa's
Actually it was pretty funny
Then he starts telling me about the war
I hope one day I have stories even half that interesting
How's everything going at your house
Here is the activity breakout that we discussed
If you need more detailed information please give me a call
Besides I already had my luggage allotment
My box wasn't nearly as heavy as yours is
What kind of tree did you buy
What is it an iron statue of a tree
Are you leaving tomorrow
I know I've asked you this before but I can't remember
If you don't have any plans let's go to lunch
I have a few questions for you
Why did you not take it with you
I called Continental and they said they would accept it
Well I am not sure about the whole thing
First it is so big that it doesn't even fit in my car
I had to take it home with the trunk open
Anyways I hope I can see you before I leave for Mexico
I probably just drop by and say bye
I'll let you know about the whole EBS thing
I'll send it tomorrow I promise
Sorry to hear about your airport travels
When is she starting on the east desk...they need help
They screwed their position up again today
Of course it could have been better without the rain
So we spent most of Sunday afternoon playing with the baby
He was talking about the baby monitors they got
This is your parents
Yeah but you know I can't resist an opportunity to make a sarcastic remark
Yeahh.I think you are better off there
Personally I do not like the idea
I was asking what you thought about the whole EBS thing not about my nervousness
I think that's kind of funny
As for the rotation I wouldn't exactly say I know Brian but I met him at the Morton's dinner
Well actually I might know Ibrahim's friend
Do you know Brian Hoskins
If not I know him well
Well he works in that group
He can tell us what it is about
If not we can just go trhough Ibrahim
Uppsss I feel I have SOOOOO Much to learn
I really feel behind
You never responded me
Ok ok maybe you do not want to go
Don't deny it
I know you too well
So where are we going to watch the game
Tell him I'm definitely interested
Are they trying to sign up customers or providers or what
I don't think most people would understand the humor but I thought it was really funny
I just sent and email to two AA people
Have they let you out of orientation yet
How did your meeting go
I've attached the Gas Bench Porfolio that we discussed
If you need any more information just let me know
I have assumed the responsibility for publishing the Gas Reports
When you fall...I will point and laugh at your clumsy butt
This is my oath.....I pledge this till the end
Why do you always get him started
Thursday sounds good to me
Thursday it is
Mark my word
Hey Dawn I noticed there were a few people from the group missing from your email
Did you want me to forward it to them
Thursday or Friday sounds good to me
I also need to take Thurs
Please let me know soon
Lunch sounds good to me
Name a day and chances are I can make it
See you in two weeks
And Anne...well I can't even explain that
Let me digress for just a moment to talk about work
It seems we took too much as broker fees in July
I'm sure I'm not telling you anything you don't know
Hope you enjoyed your trip
I just got you email but I do want to be in on the gift for Becky
Where are you located now
I'm not here...at least my mind anyway
I take it you aren't too busy today
Sorry I missed you guys for lunch yesterday
I didn't get your email until yesterday afternoon
I've been in class for two days...Derivatives I
PS If I forget my bras I'm just not going to bother
No one would notice if I forgot my bras
I'll take lots of pictures so you can see them
I no longer need to receive Hyperion updates
I'll have my phone with me in case anyone needs anything
I will be in class Tuesday and Wednesday
I thought of you two when I read this
Okay here's a trivia question for you
Do you see the absurdity of our lives
I don't know anyone over level II
I never did get to swim though
Of course there was none at the airport so officially it didn't rain yesterday
When do you leave for Australia
Bring me back something nice
It sounds like a really fun job and they made an offer I can't turn down
Glad to hear you haven't dried up and blown away
They said we got rain here but being from LA I say we got a little drizzle
I have two right now
I leave for Sydney a week from Saturday
And you're right there's no hope for keeping me in line
I think I'll just retire early and stay over there
I would make a very good beach bum
I don't seem to own casual clothes anymore...especially not spring clothes
I'm going to have to pack everything I own
Are you trying to make me blind like you
I'm hoping they have good movies on the flight
I think I must have become a little annoying myself
I'll take your Visa
Just let me know when you've mailed it
It's nice to know I have good tastes
I decided to let you use them
It's too hot up here to use them
Maybe if it ever rains
You did a very good job picking it out
I actually went to the driving range this weekend
I definitely think I could get hooked on this sport
Did I tell you I'm working daylight hours again
I thought you'd appreciate this email from my brother
Mom call the other day and thanked me for her present
What did I get her
How much did you pay for your clubs
By the way I thought using company email was a nice touch
Both of my machines
So are you going to enter
I hope this explanation makes sense and is acceptable
How scandulous of your mother
I was completely shocked...I didn't even know what to say
I know it's hard to imagine me speechless but I was
Let me know if you want to go to lunch
I'll call you when I get in
Therefore I don't believe it should be included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio
I went home last weekend for my mom's birthday
If I get any good family emails I'll let you know
I will not be able to attend this meeting
I thought you'd appreciate the humor in these
Hell I thought Billy Graham was some singer or something
I will be attending the dinner
I have not taken any time off this time period
Yes I got it a few minutes after I sent you the email
Are you still working on the CanadaPower file
She's been drinking the water here hasn't she
There was at least a third of it left but it's in the trash now
You're welcome to come get it
That's your FAVORITE joke
That was a really lame joke...in fact it was pathetic
Well I feel privileged to be included in your daily entertainment
What kind of twisted diet are you on
I had a sandwhich
That's all well and good but where are my text files
No I promise I didn't...your post-id crashed my system
We're going again though so I should have your position in a few minutes
I would like to attend the Cornell Brown Bag
I'm having to plug your positions again
I'll talk to you tomorrow
Let me guess all the time
Have you tried talking that way to her
Let me know what happens
I think I'll skip the run this week
Here's the book request I spoke with you about
Please let me know when this book is set up
I'm not in accounting any more so I no longer need this email
I promise I didn't forget about you tonight
I have not taken any time off
I'm SO Sorry that I forgot about you
Did you get my message about the books
I especially liked the chain saw and the flame thrower
Thought you all might be able to use this sometime
I did think of something Dad might want
Call mom and ask her what he wants
You do know they are slave drivers right
Of course I'm sure it's no worse than my current job
Well it's about time I got started working today
And no I have no ideas...not even bad ones
I have also included the detail that supports the GRMS position
Let me know how we did
As for the master deal id as long as they are all unique what you had was fine
If you have any more questions just give me a call
Please review the spreadsheet guidelines I sent
I am having to recreate your text files every night
The INTRA-CNT-TRANS problem was on my end
I have attached the items you requested
Let me know how they look
I haven't been able to load the text file yet
But I'll send that as soon as I have it
I also included the detail
I think we should park at Samy's again
What have you been up to today
He asked me who knew the reports besides me
What do you think about parking
Do we park at Samy's Parking lot
Here are your positions including the exotics
Here are your FT Positions exlcuding the exotics
Are you going to send me the exotics spreadsheet tonight
It was good but it keeps coming back to visit
I had m&c a banana and gatorade
And he told me they were actually losing money
I don't think he appreiciated me sharing my opinion with him
That sounds fine to me
If my understanding isn't correct please let me know
But I think everything thing should be okay to implement tomorrow
That's why you saw prompt month positions for 'GAS-DAILY-OPT-GDL' those are all from Option deals
If you have any question give me a call
It is just a concatenate problem but I don't have access to that file
If you or Michael could fix that I would appreciate it
Here are your positions and I also included the detail
Here are your positions for tonight
We are off on FT CAN but remember I included the Exotics text file in that position
I am also attaching IM Canada
Here are your positions
I saw Me Myself and Irene too
It was pretty good as long as you're in the mood for stupid humor which I was
Usually language doesn't bother me at all but that was a little excessive
Well I better get busy
If you have any more questions let me know
I am having to manually override that post-id everyday
However we should also include any deals in out months that are fixed price gas daily deals
Here are you positions
The dung was actually thawing him out
I am having to manually override the post-ids
Let me know if they're okay
As you will see these positions are significantly different
I've had fun teasing...I mean working with you
I just got your email so it'll be a little while
Have you had a chance to review the positions yet
Here are the three Book IDs that I am looking for
Mom and I did have a good weekend
We were laughing last night b/c we really didn't do anything
She said to tell you she's sorry she ruined your weekend
I told her you didn't mind that she was here
What'd you end up doing last night
Here are the positions I have
I'll give you a call when I get it
This is definitely me
So when did you get here
And what are you doing
I was wondering if I had the right email address
Email me back if this is you
If you have any more questions feel free to call me
Why does that not surprise me
I have no idea what you're trying to say
So just imagine me nodding my head and smiling politely
I know she doesn't have any spare time
Maybe she utilizes her time by doing two things at once
Are there thousands of kids on your floor too
We now know what Enron employees do in their spare time
I have learned how to prepare the NGP&L
I have learned how to prepare the Benchmark
I updated the Greg Pos
Report so that it ties to the Benchmark in total and reflects the Lavorato time buckets
I have not included any accomplishments from my former group
Yeah your position has definitely been the bright spot of the day
I'm having a bad enough day...I don't need your crap too
Hopefully we look as good as last night
Why are you still here
It's b/c you don't have me there to control things
Sounds like you as busy as we are
So quit reading your email and get to work
Eric is putting his storage entries in today
Shannon has to manually key them in the matrix
I wouldn't be either
Tony has put in a million entries and so have I
Can you smell the garlic from there
See if you like this one better
Here's what I received from the Analyst program
In addition we will provide relocation assistance for your household goods and car transportation
I think this is a record you guys
Let us know if there are any problems
I told you I had a rough day
I was DYING by the last game
So what are you still doing here
I don't even sprint
And I slid yesterday twice so I have a little bit of a rasberry on my calf
Did that get me any sympathy
I hope you finish close soon
Hard ass aren't I
And I played every second of every game
Now don't you feel sorry for me
What were you doing here Sunday
And I definitely agree that food is not payment for overtime
We played our softball tournament yesterday
So I ran most of the day it felt like
Let me know how the MRI comes out
She says she needs a couple more days off
I think I'd go to another hair dresser
I need another day off because I worked so much Thursday Friday and Sunday
I checked the conversion factors in our system
I had the factors that you sent me so I don't know why we are pulling different factors
Let me know how the position looks tonight
Do you have a place to live yet
Let me know when its official so I can tell the group you're coming
Let me know if that date's okay for you
I'll let you know if anything changes
I haven't heard from you in awhile
We would still love to have you in Chicago
Let me know what you are thinking
If I do need to submit an expense report who should I turn it in to
I don't know I haven't heard anything today
I start my new job in Chicago next week
I got the impression you were not so convinced
Let me know when you can get out of here
I guess we'll have to ride the bus
Unless you want to try to bribe the parking people again
I spoke with Monica about this issue yesterday
If so we will no longer send it
Did you see
She completely blew me off
I submitted a more specific question this time
Thanks for the explanation b/c I was completely clueless
Are you watching this eSpeak
I asked about why we have arbitrarily assigned PRC reps but she hasn't answered that yet
My day sucks so far...how about yours
I don't know what the big deal was
That mistake was something I should have caught
So what are you up to today
Do you have any calzones this morning
I am attaching a revised P&L by Trader
I moved the Term_GD p&l from Lambie to McKay
It looks like the file got updated after we pulled in the final Feb p&l
Could you please take a look at them
Well I might finally be getting somewhere on my move
I now have an informal offer that is acceptable
I just need it in writing now
We need to all go to lunch before I leave
Good luck ignoring your neighbor
The details I don't care to hear but I can't help it

The answer is that in this instance it gives him all the power
What do I mean
Who is it under the Constitution that is specifically charged with certifying the Electoral College votes of each state

The government takes them both and denies they ever existed
You and your neighbors decide who gets the milk
Your neighbors pick someone to tell you who gets the milk
The government takes both and drafts you into the army
If there aren't any they invent some
They pay you not to milk the cows
The government promises to give you two cows if you vote for it
The cows sue you for breach of contract
Your legal bills exceed your annual income
Remember those cannot be used for blackmail when I run for mayor of New York

I think I gave you his home number
Harry Wanted to get your comments on your conversation with Michael
Michael I just had another brief conversation with Harry
Please let me know if we agree with the mws
How's your brother doing - has he gone back to work
On a good note we got your picture of the little tike= looks great
I hope all is going well and thanks for the e-mail
Talk t= o you soon
Do you still have a job
See you at home
As per our conversation attached is my resume
As you know I'm interested in Corporate Development / M&A structured finance and venture capital
So whenever the best time for you is just let me know
I have your palm
The guy from Archer called me this morning
Have you had a chance to call him
What time do you want to pick up the car
I will be going up to Cinci a week from today
Yes - I think so
I am still employed just waiting to be bought out by a bank like Citigroup or UBS
My e-mail at work which is fine to send it to is benjamin.rogers@enron.com
I will send you and McCabe my resume today
I am stillin shock over everything that happened last week
Dad Here is a quick stock analysis spreadsheet you should really get to use
Did you have a chance to meet with Harry
I was suppose to come up but some of the guys weren't available
Talk to you soon and have a good week
After church after lunch/brunch you are going down
Please tranfer my parking over to the Allan Center
Dave I hope all is going well
I decided to not except the UBS deal so I wanted to come work for you and Janet
Since I have already talked with these guys I am pretty much available today going forward
Again you know what I have done and I think it would be a good fit
I will call him today
Ben I have to email the Head of School and schedule a meeting with her before she leaves
When do you suggest I tell her
Have you talked to your dad
Again make sure your guys are looking at it right
Merrill came out with a good report on you guys today
I need to talk to you about a couple of things
Someone has too much free time on their hands
Change the font to Wingdings Look at what you have
I always think it comes down to your mother
I'll send the beer boy but I don't have your home email
Ben Good speaking with you
There are a couple who have been looking elsewhere some I think with Goldman
Let me see where those guys are at
Thanks again and talk to you soon
Ben I don't know who you may know on the trading side
I appreciate the referrals
Rosanna Sorry about not getting back with you
I am still interested in talking with your contacts
I will call you tomorrow morning
Thanks again for your patience and help with this issue
Ben I have been unable to contact you
Greg I went to the meeting to look at valuing some of the outstanding contracts
Carefull - Don't make me deny you of sex
I thought you all would enjoy this
Billy Good to see you back online
Need to play some tennis before I leave
What his D.N.C
Complication and secrecy are mother's milk to them while the average investor's best protection is full disclosure
For too long new-economy corporate creeps and their accounting Heeps have hidden risk in arcane off-the-books dealing
Dad Let me know if you got the FedEx package I sent you yesterday
Interesting are you around for a late lunch
Hey Where do you think Delaney goes
Ultimately I want to learn more about the overall operations and effective energy risk management
Hope you are doing well and good luck with everything
I will send you my new information at Cinergy
My Dad would love to hear from you sometime
Chobs Sorry it took so long to respond but its been crazy around here
Both KMI and KMP are still good buys its just the overall market environment thats bringing these down
Is it just because of the economy
Is this their cyclical low period
Let me know because if it is a bargain low
I want to buy more too
Missy If you could change that to a taxi service that would be great
Just let me know your preference
I have also attached directions to our facility
Dad Cliff sent you his resume
Thanks again and I'll talk to you soon
Mr Lay It was good to see you down on the trading floor today
I came over from the corp development group after we sold the peakers to Allegheny and to Cinergy
Jeff I think we may be past due on when we need to play by but thats fine
I think Saturday works for me as well
I know things are quite busy right now so good luck with everything
I will still call you when we get there
Remember to call me
Great talking to you today
Here are the changes recommended by my legal group
Easter was great how 'bout yours
It was just me Lisa and a friend of mine
How's everything been with you
Have you seen Bruce lately
How 'bout my brother
What's the website you bought the Adirondack chairs off of
I'll tell you what
Of course after you assemble the chair
This is what our legal guys would prefer
I have attached a listing of all my Bid Week transactions
Anyway besides this we don't seem to have much going on
Did you guys move to the Galleria location yet
I hope he had a blast
In terms of your email reply you can have Calpine
PG&E and Edison International are doomed as they should be
I honestly think they are incable of solving the problem
Did you go to any parties last night
I was lame I didn't go to a single one
I heard there were some decent ones
I don't think many buying opportunities out there
I feel we've just seen the beginning
If you own any CA real estate sell
I hope Lowery has held off on buying his house
I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home
One redeeming factor is that we bought on a good block
However with your boy Grey Davis pushing for price caps this won't happen
The other factor of course is that you could have an increase in supply - new power plants
Again this is only my opinion so you could take it with a grain of salt
Have you experienced any blackouts yet
I think you'll see a lot this summer
Do they think it's a threat or not
Unfortunately I won't be able to make it but thanks for the email
Thought you might appreciate this
I saw Yeull Tuesday night - pretty cool huh
Wow what a gracious thank you
By the way are you going to any events during Gas Fair
Congratulations to you and Rena
Please let me know when the deals are changed
Early congrats on your graduation
Are you and Paul still together
How is he doing
When is the last time you were back in Jersey
You both are always welcome to stay at our house
What will you be doing
You guys aren't moving are you
Give me a call when you get in
Are you enjoying yourself
Keep me up to date on how everything is going
Instead they compare employee against employee
But they fell out of favor in part because they were seen as damaging employee motivation
Olson said she doesn't see a problem with motivation
People like to know how they stand and will work hard to reach the top category she said
And as for figuring out what it takes to be superior
Hope you are doing quite well
In terms of longer term I think a lot depends on how the state tries to resolve the problem
What's your time frame on a house
I would be concerned about the energy situation so just try to keep abreast of it
Also you could call me if you have any questions
I'll try to help the best I can
Take care and tell Kim and Kendall I said hi
I start my Texas travel in February
You'll be seeing more of me than you want
I thought I had your home phone # but I only have your work #
As a result I didn't call you this weekend
I hope you had a good one
First of all you sent me a picture with the head cut off
I couldn't even see Kendall
In regards to California's energy crisis I think that California is screwed - big time
I think it has the potential to cripple the state's economy
If like you said noone really talks about it much in SoCal I would bet that will change soon
But remember that is just my meaningless opinion
When do you start coming to Texas
Let me know so we can try to hook up
What's your opinion on him
I was wondering how the citizens of California viewed him
Hope everything is going well with Kim Kendall and yourself
Send an updated picture if you have one
I'll give you a call this weekend
Tell me about the new job
I've emailed you after both of your messages
Did you fail to get them
Sorry it took me so long to reply
I hope you picked up some EOG on Friday or today
If you could only own one stock what would it be
If you could make it we'd all love to see you
Tell Chris we said hi
Hope everything is going great for the both of you
What time will you be in
Call or email Stacey Dempsey to reserve your spot
Sorry it's taken me so long to reply but I just checked my email
This better understanding I find typically leads to self improvement and greater control and ultimately more happiness in life
However do not let it lead to any form of regret - that would be unfair
We all have regrets but these regretted actions typically make us stronger and better people in the long run
As you might imagine I got a kick out of that
I haven't forgot abt the Hawaiin Electric position
I'll try to get in touch with my friend today
Here are the two that I have for her
Please forward them to Patty
Please let me know whether or not you received notice
I want to make sure the files have been updated appropriately
I have been promoted out of the Associate program last PRC
As a result if you could take me off the Analyst/ Associate distribution list I'd deeply appreciate it
We've just been swamped with the house we recently bought
Tell everyone we said hi
Depending on how old it is I definitely wouldn't recommend it as your primary car
Hope you had a good time at the wedding
I'm glad you had a great time
I hope you felt the same way
I need to take a look at the following contracts
I appreciate the email
The important thing obviously is that you get better
We'll all miss you very much
Tell Tom and John we said hi
No bottles allowed but you can bring cans or cups
Could you please provide me with copies of the attached contracts
I think you received a similar request from Tom Donaho
My bro' was supposed to get in touch with you
I hope you could go
Could you please give Coun Ricigs and Sweets a call to see if they have any interest
Are you in the states
Do you still have an interest in the group
Congratulations to the both of you
Please let me know status as soon as possible
See you then unless I hear back from you
Do you have any availability this week
I wouldn't be surprised
Sweet house - I hope everything works out
When are you trying to close
Did they accept your offer
We haven't done much on the house since your visit
Tell Marie we said hi
Looking forward to seeing you Gloria and Tommy over Christmas
Let me know what your schedule is like
Please send me a few recommended B&Bs and restaurants
They both bought their engagement rings from Bill
He should encourage you to shop his prices
I found him to be very competitive
Is there something I could do to facilitate the process
Let me know when everything is a go
Your favorite hobby She'll probably say I have no hobbies
Where you were born Mt
Most favorite trip that you have taken together
You're correct I am saddened to see such a great x-Philly treated so poorly
All our weekends are spent working on it
I gotta run but thanks for the email
Let me know how everything is going in your world
Tell Rina and the kids we said hi
I'll pick you up on Thursday and I'll take Friday off
I am no longer in the A/A program
I got promoted this past review period
Please let me know if you got the update or not
I have no additional info
I was waiting to hear back from you
I'll give them a call
I already checked
Do you have your schedule yet
Still waiting to hear back about your possible visit
Did you pull the trigger
Could you call me when we're set to trade w/ Cinnabar
Thanks for your help I appreciate it
I'm glad you guys like the gift
I think Moller does though
Let me know if you need his #
Take care and tell Rena and Luke we said hi
It would be great to see you and Marie
I hope you could make it out
I'll make sure we save the date
I told him that if anything changes let me know
I got a call from Peremes on Saturday
I guess she just chose to ignore me as usual
Hopefully it'll be habitable by the time you see it
Sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you
Don't tell her though she's the only one I haven't mentioned anything to
I'll make sure you and Moller get to share a room
She's really annoyed me the last few times I've seen her
By that time we should have it in decent shape
We'll be busy for the next year working on it
I think when it's done it'll look pretty cool
Take care and tell Marie we said hi
Gas Trading is my final rotation
This is my permanent position
We thank you in advance for your co-operation
Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you
I'm glad you accepted a job at Enron
I know you'll enjoy it
I would not recommend EES however
Could you please extend the guest id that expired for FTEnergy the publisher of gas daily
Please call me when this is completed
We need to have these folks view our daily indices
Hope you enjoyed dinner
Also what happens if you withdraw in Mar and the Summer peaks higher than what you withdrew at
I'll talk to you after you get back from Houston
I hope that didn't surprise you
I couldn't be happier for you two
We were out for the day that's why didn't get back to you
I'll try you today
Have you moved into your new office
I'm interested in talking to you about the lunch discussion
Great to hear from you as always
It'll be great to have you back in the states
By the way I attached a copy of the boys
I hope it comes across OK
We figured we could put the money toward a house and save a lot of anger frustration and stress
Have you been to many Bears games
I think a lot is due to their youth
Keep me in mind for next time though
Good luck during your final semester
That is if you ever get you LLC set up
If I understand you correctly it may depend to an extent on season basis differentials as well
I received the email
What's your work #
I need to give you a call
I need your LA address
Are you heading home for the holidays or staying in LA
Also if you have Lowery's address and phone # could you forward it
Make sure you tell Paul I said Hi
Thought you might like some interesting reading on ENE
Thanks Lee I appreciate it
However let me check with Lisa and I'll get back to you for sure
May be we go back to Thai Pepper
Where are you moving to
We just bought a new house ourselves
Thought you might find the article interesting
I saw that unbelievable huh
Did you get an opportunity to call Kampy
Hopefully one day it will slow
You think we could bottle what he's got
Send me an email or give me a call
Anyway thought you might find it amusing
In my opinion some of these execs former and current should go to jail
I'm sure it will be a best seller
Anyway let me get off my soapbox
I'm glad to hear you got a new job
We're both looking forward to hooking up with you guys
Take care and good to hear from you
Gave the dot.com world a shot and timed it wrong
Will be helping them run their Corporate Service Group

Would like to drop him a message

I wanted to follow up with guys on supper club
If you're just starting you don't get many invitations

Tell Matt I said hi
Matt and I plan to play golf this Saturday morning
I understand you're a budding golfer
Care to join us
I bet that's what happened
I can get you a copy
If you have a copy please send me a copy and I'll pay you for it
Did you catch the interview on Fox
Anyway what's up on your front
Where your seats near where the homer dropped
It really comes down to what you want
Again it comes down to the pax
If so does it handle as well with the added size and weight
If you think it's a factor spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back
How's everything on your front
What happened to it
Can't it be fixed or are you just abandoning it
Where are you leaning in terms of a new car
On my end the classic motorcycle is buzzing like a champ and a complete blast to drive
At least he pocketed one record
I want to let him know I won't be out there in Oct Give me a shout
I didn't think it would be that soon
Did you watch the Astros / Giants game last night
I guess he hasn't followed Kent the last few years
He doesn't even have the sack to admit he fucked up

We call him Jack
Man was it a ghost town
How's everything with you
Look for me on TV

Go ahead and sign it - I did

In case you have not heard my Dad passed on a week ago Sunday
I stayed in SF for a couple days but there wasn't much I needed to do
I am very fortunate to still be employed
On Friday they swiped about half of ENA
I thought layoffs would be minimal around this group
Some good people I worked with or out
But I think it's ok for now
They are in negotiations with a few banks to buy the floor or what is left of it
Honestly I think that is llikely to happen
Ok then drop me a line when you have a chance
What time will you be arriving at LAX
Listen I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings
That was not my intention
I still care about you
How could I not

I had dinner with Gilles August the managing partner of the firm on Friday
I think his firm is exactly what you are looking for

Gilles himself is a member of the New York bar

Thanks for your quick response

Do we have a problem with Delaware for jurisdiction

While they made billions they continued to say Our company will be the greatest someday
But lo and behold it would not come to pass
So they lied and cheated stole and cajoled Analysts investors workers and sold and sold
Little did they know that confidence is what cons do
Ken restated his books and oh the looks that Were on the faces of all but the crooks
He hit floor fifty where his offices reside
With two armed guards standing at his side
Where with their cronies they devised great scams
I cannot merge with you
He thought and he thought
And so we are told the company will be back
A shell of itself but not quite the same
The shell is appropriate as we all know The core business of Ken is a shell game

Thank you for all your cooperation
May I request your indulgence as we work through this phase
As the Test Plan is developed I will keep everyone informed as much as possible
At this time I see no problems
Prior to running the tools we need to do two pig runs in each line for cleaning
Do you see a problem
Do you see any problem
Darrell Per our phone conversation this morning I'm requesting gas to run pigs on the Panhandle Lateral next week

Actively chasing TD Williams and PII for their cost estimates
If my memory is bad someone let me know
This will allow us to set our HP accordingly
However I will check with OPS team to reverify volumes
Amy and I agree on the numbers
We need to keep our communications open to the plant
Hopefully when they become operational their loads will be more steady
If you have any more questions please call
This is for our protection
Lindy You are correct they are physical plant receipt points
I don't think any of these are straddle plants
Sorry it took me so long to respond
Maybe you already have answers to this
I'm afraid I asked you this question before but I can't find where I wrote down your answer
Please read I'm sure you will be getting some calls
I'm sure we will be getting some calls so we thought we would let you know
Please someone give me some ideas
Presently it is unknown what kind of problems will be uncovered on inspection of the unloaders
Dave can you do this for us
Should it be
I'm not sure if I should include it on my report
Depending on system conditions we may have to allocate
I will be on the road headed back to Amarillo today
I'm sorry tomorrow afternoon is not available for me
I have a ortho
On Thursday afternoon I have to back for my retainers
Can we meet sometime in the morning
Once I get a list of potential participants I will put some dates and time= s together
Please add it between Mapco and Red Cedar points
If they are in the total please exclude them
They said it was more like drip
We will work with you any way we can
At any given time I am told that they have about a million dollars worth of material in production
If they lose fuel the product is lost and we could be liable
They used to have the contract but when we got it they removed their meter setting
Obviously we will negotiate that amount but they have us at a disadvantage
What do you think we can do to work something out
There is no one else from our group
I tried calling Sammy Williams he too i= s in Houston
I also paged Randy Fitzgerald he has not ret= urned my call
I= didn't see it on your first and finals either
If you have any questions please feel free to ask
Right now I can plan on being there
I will not be able to attend I will be on vacation all next week
Dale once we have the additional requests will you foward them to Ben or would you like me to
I will be glad to help
If these points are sufficient it will be straight forward to map these to modbus registers
If more points are required we will need permission from Citizens to modify their FSTs
Gary Spraggins Steve January or myself will not be able to participate on the call
What is your availability after lunch on Wednesday
Hi Darryl Would you be available for the following visit
Linda I have reviewed the procedures briefly - but wanted to respond as time get away
On your first request for down time next week
We can communicate this to your Team Friday afternoon
At this time we cannot committ to your outage requests
I will visit with Mike O'Donnell about our imbalance
God bless each of you
In the name of our Lord and Savior Christ Jesus
To answer your firm question
So my question Have we sold firm through March yet or is that month still available for maint
If I'm not making any sense give me a call
If there are no objections I will change the dates to the new schedule listed below
If its still works for you lets give it a try
The only concerns at this time may be parts delivery time but I think we will be ok
Let me know if this will work for you
I've got egg on my face
D can we do this in January
Please let us know if this outage date is acceptable
Below is a perliminary report that Citizens sent and their recommendation
I will let everyone know the dial in number on Monday
I will be on vacation tomorrow
I don't know where he is leading with this
Although I questioned this requirement at the time the low flow condition occurs so rarely it is inconsequential
All we are asking is the same in return
Is this what you were asking me for
Please if I'm looking at this wrong please correct me
Can we look at late Feb or early March
Please e-mail your thoughts
We have multiplied our possessions but reduced our values
We've conquered the atom but not our prejudice
Remember spend some time with your loved ones because they are not going to be around forever
Let me know when this is finalized
Please let me know if this time works for you
Once finalized I will email to the full distribution list
I don't think that decision has been made
I think we should be allocating
If I understand correctly the scheduled volume is continually higher than the flow
Why don't we allocate this point to minimize the imbalance
Darrell and John could you two be sure we discuss this afternoon
I told him to get started
Should we re-apply
Yes we do and I will make copies
Please meet in my office
Darrell do you have those interview questions that we have used in the past
Please let me know if this will not work for anyone
Allen can you come to Houston to attend the meeting
Once we know how many people and when to schedule classes we'll contact the instructor
Call if you have questions or concerns
Should we be allowing this volume to be scheduled
Please don't hesitate to call if you need help
I will be out Thursday afternoon
Sure I can make the Friday time frame
Darrell perhaps Jerry and I can get with you either tomorrow or sometime next week to get your viewpoint
I can change the indicator for TW in PLE if that is what you are asking
What does West Texas have to do with it
Does this mean we can inactivate it on TW
Linda Are you OK on the other changes Maggie noted or do we need to get with you
I appologize for some confusion
Jackrabbit we can inactivate
They will watch it
Guess I should'nt assume they know to do that
TW will work with Griffith as we can
On Friday we will do the tests as detailed below
I had Maria send this to me
I think we can utilize this attachment
Mike I think we can go ahead and do the work
There is no flow affect right now so I don't see a problem doing one unit at a time
Darrell what's your thoughts
Do we need to wait until the tarriff months are over
Jerry can you send me an outage request form
All Per Darrell and Jerry's comments below we can proceed with the unloader installation at any time
I talked to Ed and had a message from Jon
The diving crew has located the exact source of the leak and they are continuing repairs
Some customers have been calling and inquiring if they should nom

If you have any questions please let me know next week
If I have misstated plz advise
Ok Blackie sounds Ok to me
Mickey hope this answers you questions
If not call me
If not please let me know who we need to talk to
In order to insure our pipeline integrity we need to work through these obstacles and get something resolved
Yes but we are waiting to hear from Darrell on this one
Is this an official request to amend their contract or will they send that later
If you have any ideas let us know
Hey guys I was not able to get the group rate
Hopefully you can find a good rate on your own
These are the people I have down for the meeting
If there is anyone that I missed please let me know
Thank you Jerry Graves Sr
If this doesn't make any sense please let me know
I will look at the posting I had previously
Per our discussion on Friday attached are the spreadsheets that show the dig locations for the integrity work
I second Jerry's statement below
I agree also
I believe that is a really good idea
So anything they can do to protect the H.P
I would like your comments
I don't know if this is the case here
If the control system has unacceptable dead band then the economics should justify replacing it
Pat please give me your thoughts on this issue then I will discuss with Gas Control
Jeff I am in agreement with you
As you know we have exceeded the MAOP a couple of times since I have been here
Do you see any reason not to pursue this
Now that we have all the parties involved here is what we need
As far as the Leedey Lateral goes we need to pig but economics will be hard
Will you be in the rest of the week
If it is okay I may need to get with later next week
Lynn Sherry called in and her mom passed away last night
She will give us further details when she has them
I think these will be just fine
Talk to tk but I think these will be fine
I guess this is ok if you are
If R Hannigrif is fine with it then I will be good
I will be in the office tomorrow
Hey tk how are you doing

I hate all of this shit
I don't know if you've read this one
It kind of made me sick to be honest
I slept good also
If people you thought had standards ethics and morals are now applying pressure whets the use
I slept really well last night
Maybe the Employees deserve what they get
Good question...it is a shame he did not answer it
Sorry about not returning your call this morning
Like it made any difference
They would not address any of my questions
I have concluded that the Employees deserve what they have gotten
I'm not sick just lost my faith in everyone
Except you of course
Are you listening to the investor conference call
Are you going to the employee meeting
It also sounded like you are sick
Not too much going on up here just the usual pissed off customers yelling at me
If I can help its yours
I believe their is a reason for everything
Laura Please let them know that I do not plan on attending
I do not have names or phone numbers
Here is a kitty for your office

At your convenience let's meet to discuss
Please contact me if you have any questions about my changes
I will be happy to answer any questions you might have
Aurora my changes appear on the attached
Jeff here it is
Did Stan make the call to FERC I wonder
That way we don't appear uncooperative just incompetent
Just let me know how else I can help here
Sheila and Lindy I am not sure I am comfortable giving them any costs
Maybe we should discuss before giving them anything
Tammy As you may be aware SoCalGas is going through Gas Industry Restructuring.
One of our settlement proposals is to provide pooling service.
If you need copies of these letters let me know and I'll send them to you also
Depending on the overall look I may or may not acknowledge that Bill is my date
If you are free that weekend why don't I plan to come either Fri or Sat
Didn't know what color I had used so I chose a new one
Are you still going to SA for your continuing ed
They're not as comfortable as I thought they'd be
Once we've signed a real agreement I do want to file something in support
I haven't yet begun to think about a declaration
Are you folks concerned about something that I'm missing
Although I personally haven't seen the document yet it was the primary focus of the meeting
I'll defer to my distinguished colleagues including the now-quite-full-of-herself Susan Scott
Do you remember Rob Carty from high school
I barely recognized him because he has gotten so hefty
With his checkered overalls cowlick curl and penchant for double-burgers Big Boy seemed an unlikely fit for Bangkok
Take care and drop me a line when you can
In addition to adding material we have made some changes in language in the last version.
I'm with Susan in her office listening to the call
Are you going to raise the issue
Mark Susan and I are online in her office if you need to shoot us a quick note
Oops wrong one -- I meant MK had comments on Red Cedar
I don't necessarily think it does
If you have comments please let me know
I'm available Tuesday also -- just let me know
If I can find some other names/numbers for you I will
Glen I think this will be fine
I have shown a list of signatories that is from our filing two weeks ago with a few additions
I haven't cross-checked against signature pages received or expected but will do so before I file
Damage Bond/Right of Way or Water Lease Thanks for your help
I plan to put Mr Fawcett on as a witness
I can e-mail the agreement to him if you prefer
We haven't received them yet
I could really use your help in responding to this argument
Please respond so we can get a signoff
Hey there enjoyed hearing about your shopping adventures
Do you agree with my conclusion
Do you have some time Friday morning to talk about this
As far as I know our marketers have been following this
If we need to discuss this further please let me know
I'll work on changing it this evening
I'll let you know Mon-Tues what we decide
As you can see there are several holes yet to be filled in particularly with respect to cites/references.
My initial impression is yes we would have to make a filing
Am I out of my mind
Drew I've attached my proposed changes to the Red Cedar contract
Our beloved Min/Max Language became a bit problematic as you can see
I'd welcome your comments on this
I just got this today and think I understand the problem
Let me know how Steve's conversation with Baldwin goes
Yes I will send you a draft shortly
Susan are you preparing a response to their intervention
Susan would it be beneficial to add more about the need for the service
Based on our experience with Hubbard it could take months to correct the problem
Nominations are expected to exceed existing capacity this week in which case we will have to allocate
When the compressor is actually tested and really in service we'll let them know
The downside we get no reservation charge at all
The downside shippers will never trust us again
For now I think it's important to get a decision on one of the above options
The longer we wait to get information to our shippers the bigger our customer relations problem will be
Sounds like a great idea -- let us know where/when
Let me know where we need to go from here
Please let me know if we need to discuss further
Too bad all of us are captive to Eric's schedule
Bill and I enjoyed our too-short trip to the GC
We hiked down Bright Angel trail to the second rest stop which was plenty for me
You might have to pay for extra hotel days that way but at least you would get to go
Jeff we only need to send a copy to the Judge electronically
I'll e-mail one to Brian Cherry as well and to anyone else who specifically requests it
If you would prefer that I send to everyone electronically let me know
That was pretty strenuous but definitely worth it
I know that Texaco probably has it on their website
If you don't find anything let me know
Hope you took a lot of photos
Can't wait to hear all about it
I had a good time with Grayson
Jim and I fed her bottles Sat and Sun and she took them without a whimper
Everytime you look at her she breaks out in a huge smile
Are you coming next weekend
Everything else is looking pretty good with all our rains
They say they should come back nicely
I assume you'll be in Austin for Mother's Day
I have no idea what to buy her
Trivia time last night I went to the Astros game with some people from work
I sent a picture of Grayson to multiple people including you
Please let me know if you received it
If not I will try again
If you DID get it let me know if you have any problems opening it
Dave I'll bring you a copy of that agreement
Rich if Mike did not send you one let me know and I will fax it to you
Please let me know if it looks alright to you
I'm available to discuss this whenever you are then I will make sending this to Mike top priority
If this is not acceptable please let me know
If we hear anything more we'll keep you all informed
How nice to hear from you
I too am in no rush to have kids
I am so glad you're enjoying Tampa
I will never regret leaving Austin for Houston
But it's a good crash course in business for me and my clients are wonderful
Hi how are you doing
I got your e-mail address from Aunt Sheila
Are you excited about being an Aunt
I am in no hurry to have kids
Actually I am in no hurry to get married
I think I would be good dad although I would have to settle down a bit
But that won't happen anytime soon as I am enjoying the Tampa area too much
I moved down here last August and am loving it
Are you still enjoying it there
Have you made partner yet
Have you seen much of Grayson since her birth
If you don't know for sure what the answer is just say so
Inasmuch as I haven't been part of the development process please check this document carefully for errors and/or misrepresentations
Can you believe I actually have a gift for Jim already
I'll try to get there as early as I can tomorrow
To make things worse I think a ghost has appeared to Goo
She is really freaked out about something pacing around and acting like she hears things
Gabby is her usual self
I'm not going to give him his gift until next week
I haven't heard for sure but they will probably leave Sat. maybe after dinner like before
Joan is in it as well
I'll just get with Ramona in the a.m and see when she can meet & we'll go from there
I know the business folks are anxious to hear our strategy
I would appreciate your comments on the attached
Please ignore my previous e-mail which included the wrong attachment
Wow you struck a nerve with this one
Of course everyone but me thinks it is really cute
Hope your holiday was really great
Please let me know if you have comments
Pumpkin is welcome to stay over at your place
I love dogs and wish I could justify having one
I had a fun time this weekend
She gets such a kick out of seeing her
Wish they lived closer and I could have just stopped by
I have really never had this problem before
It's good to have a lot of energy but you have to shut down sometime
Am sending you my travel schedule for next week
Hope you had a good trip back home yesterday
I really do wish Houston were at least an hour closer
I wish Karin had been more help to you but then she never has been
I really appreciate all your work
I think I was all tuckered out from our Sun
We usually go out to lunch but I don't want to miss any baby time
In case you do not have my draft of the filing here it is
Makes it really hard to plan
He was in Bullhead City of all places where his uncle has a vacation home
I joined him a few days later in Vegas
If you would like a copy of the order let me know
If you need anything further please don't hesitate to call
Thanks for all your hard work on this
I'll be here if you have any questions
Thus we will handle the service agreement manually
Hard copies of this document are being delivered to you today
If this meets with your approval please execute two originals and send them to me
Well I wanted you to have something to open ON your birthday
Don't know what that means but it sounds scary
Yes I saw it
If it did not arrive let me know
Although I am trying very hard to be understanding I'm not doing a very good job
But that's just me
Hope you are still having tanning weather in Austin
What are your trip dates again
To log on to PEP enter your User ID and password provided below
Once you have logged on you will be immediately prompted to change to a secure password
Christine this looks fine to me
Thanks for your expedited review
Susan let us know if you have a problem
What do you think or should Susan Scot have final say
Her group does VAR for all of Enron so in that function he is Global
We used a similar structure in a deal we did earlier this year if I recall correctly
Christine let me know which is preferable and I'll send you some language in the a.m
Mike please see the attached which incorporates the changes we discussed yesterday
If this looks acceptable to you please sign two originals and forward them to me
I would like to review the exhibit as soon as possible
Luckily we will have input re
Why don't we try to talk sometime this a.m
Hope everything went well in Florida especially you Jeff
However I did not find any case that stands for that exact proposition
In my Westlaw search I ran across the relevant case
Something's up with our e-mail but I did receive it finally
Hmmmm...I sent it out a few hours ago.
Didn't you receive it
However we think it appropriate to balance simplicity with the need to be responsive to Judge Biren's questions
In response to your inquiry Transwestern would first like to clear up the terminology being used here
Accordingly I would advise you not to participate in the conference call Jeff is setting up for tomorrow
Questions -- give me a call
You are not obligated to respond to him under these circumstances
Please let me know if he tries this again
Norm's exhibit contains factual inaccuracies we cannot live with
Any questions or comments -- let me know
If we need to discuss this further please e-mail or call
I agree that we should keep separate distribution lists for Transwestern
I have had other requests like Kevin's
As a temporary and imperfect solution I have marked the labels either All Holders or Filings
I am the marketing director in Houston for Transwestern Pipeline
However I wonder how many other folks feel the same way as I do
Further questions...let me know
I would appreciate it if you could respond to these issues
If you feel like we should meet to discuss I will be glad to set up another meeting
Does this mean we must offer a right to match
Who knows having my own gallery might actually become part of my long-range plan
If not I will have met some interesting people
If you want to come to Houston sooner I do not have much going on after my Sat
Call if you get lonely
I must think about a trip to Houston
I'll track it down and give you the particulars
Please indicate you approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY
If not I'm sure we are going to have more than enough input on Fri
I think I'm planning to come to Austin sometime on Sat
I will probably go home on Mon
Tell Jim to bring his gear and we'll go hit some
Are you bringing Bill
Do you want to play tennis w/ Jim etc
Do you know when Mema will be there
You know one of these days you are going to get stuck driving her to Austin
And she wants to try out her boat in the pool
I doubt they will be working on the weekend though
Hope you're having pretty weather as we have in Houston today
Several of my neighbors were also out so I was not the only one staring at the sky
Enjoyed the weekend and I'm looking forward to your visit
Lorraine I have no problem with Larry's proposed change or his reasons for the change
I just don't want to use this word
I don't think it's necessary in order to convey Larry's meaning
If Larry wants to talk about it I'm happy to
This would reflect how I read the Tariff provisions to apply.
I will talk to you first thing in the morning
I will foward a copy to you for your records
Steve apparently I'm developing an overactive imagination when it comes to FERC decisions
Anyway I like what Steve has done here
Susan This looks fine to me but I want to confirm one statement
If this is a problem give me a call because we'll need to discuss it with Drew
Subject to this one change I approve this agreement
Please review and advise your comments
Per our phone conversation attached is the NCE PG format
Please review and contact me with any questions or changes
So go ahead and order tickets if you like
If you and Eric planned your trip then you and I could hit the bunny slopes together
I want to take lessons and stick to the easy runs
I would love to see it
It's one of those things you wish for and then you get it
I think he's considering Park City for the first one
He says the transportation there is good and it's a good place for me to learn
Darrell went with me to The Hills Tues and I discovered the Hip Abductors
Didn't feel the workout until after my walk last night
Checked their long list of reciprocal clubs and The Met isn't one of them but that doesn't matter
Had a late lunch yesterday and no dinner so I was starved when I woke up
Sure glad to see him
At least she left early
Couldn't believe it
Did Bill make it home
I know you do not want to think about this today but I'm just thinking ahead to next week
I've reviewed the IGS market development agreement pursuant to your request
I'm unsure how it would work
Obviously we will need to flesh this out from an economic regulatory and legal standpoint
I will discuss it with Jeff when he returns
Call if you have any questions or comments to discuss
Maybe I will go this weekend
So glad you had rain over the weekend
We did too and we had had a dry spell for almost as long
Bill and I are on the outs
Of course now he is trying to be charming
Anyway I will have to tell you the whole story some other time
Ken here are the confidentiality agreements that should be signed prior to our providing information to our vendors
Well Larry just won't let go of these contract issues will he
I'm so glad you are excited
At my age I try to reserve all events of elevated blood pressure for only the esoteric things
As for the TSA rate I have a few questions
I have assumed you would make that call let us know and it would be over
Further what factors do you use to make that determination and what if any rules and regulations apply
From different views I'd like to have it all variable and you would like to have it all fixed
I will get back to you soon on the OBA stuff
I do not know the answer to your questions offhand and Ron is out this week
If not who do you think might be able to tell me
Or is it ok for the sales rep to sign it
Ken Do I need an officer in the company to sign the agreement
Sorry I have not called you back
But I'll give you a call this afternoon
What do you think of my Destin idea
Let me know whether the revisions are acceptable
As you requested
Here is the agreement with the changes you requested
I do not see any problems with this
Any questions -- give me a call
Lorraine here are a few notes from my review of the Val Verde contract and my initial impressions
In that case we can argue impossibility of performance
Also we could avoid the obligation because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force majeure
For each project we would simply enter into a short letter agreement referencing the enabling agreement
I will be out Mon
If you have questions call Jeff or me
The ball is in our court
John I think that sounds fine
Bill and I will leave for Austin tomorrow a.m as early as we can manage
First of all I'm delighted you want to stay and would not have a problem with Deron moving in
A I really do not think it is a problem
I'm sure it can be repaired
I will give the appliance folks a call
Do you know if the garage apt
A I have a bad feeling about those connections
I'll get them up and running and can get someone to haul the old washer off
Q I am guessing that they would need to be gas not electric
A I would strongly recommend a gas dryer because it is so much more economical
A I have always thought linoleum in a black & white checkerboard pattern would look really cute in there
Do you know if any paint is leftover
If I did this do you think y'all would use it or is that too impractical
Will do after I finish options draft
I spoke with Mike and Emily is going to handle moving the phones
Denise here are a few things off the top of my head
These are the people I'm most likely to have you organize meetings with distribute things to etc
I think I asked Janet only twice
Faxes I get faxes from Regulatory a lot and they generally don't call first
Mail Please open my mail and I'll try to come pick it up every day
Filing I generally avoid keeping files of useless information
Filing is pretty important to me
The good news I rarely ever go to the extent where I would have you index a file
I get her mail and phone calls all the time
I look forward very much to working with you
Since it is a maximum rate deal there is no discount letter
Christine you and Michele will need to fill in the address and account information
Questions or comments -- let me know
Janet please calendar these meetings for me
We did not respond to this or discuss it further
TW did not respond to this or discuss it further
I have added language to this effect
Elizabeth Jeff forwarded me your questions about capacity options
I've answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues
Otherwise our position is that it's not negotiated
I have the new pro forma OBA in Word format by the way
Here it is if you want to take a look
Christine I made a few changes for purposes of clarification
I have a call to James Centilli for his thoughts
I will check my voice mail
OK here's my first attempt
I believe this may suffice
What an eventful few days it has been
Sorry I didn't call over the weekend
I had my hands full painting my bedroom
Luckily I got the color right on the first try the Happy Yellow looks pretty good
Saturday I hauled my paint-covered self to the Met for a pro-am tennis tournament which was fun
Sure enjoyed my visit to Austin
Keep your freedom
Stay in my apartment
It helps that I have Kevin's support on this
I think it will work fine
Thanks for your attention to this last week
Are we on for this weekend
Painted my bedroom Happy Yellow while listening to the U.S Open weekend before last...drank a lot of beer also
Am amazed it turned out as well as it did
You said you work with someone named Hamlet right
Apparently he used to live across the street from Karin and Jim on Evans
Christine I spoke with Drew and he is OK with the changes shown in the attached
Questions--let me know
Also feel free to call Kevin if you need to discuss the reason for the change
Operation's objective is a volumetric goal but we are at risk for the gas price
It started me thinking about our whole fuel expense
Should TW be hedging the fuel that we burn
How could we hedge our fuel used
Maybe we could look for something this weekend
I'll give you a call tomorrow
Guess you didn't have to make your trip
But I might come the end of Oct to do some shopping
Drew here's my first stab at a rehearing argument
Ted I made a slight change on the first page
I know we probably do and I may have even approved them
If it would cause an administrative hassle to have two agreements let me know
Please give me your comments or approval at your earliest convenience
Additionally are you still going to Zihuatanejo Mexico
Well I think you are quite a catch
I just thought know should know - you have me hook line and sinker
Looking forward to seeing you tonight
However if there is anything you want me to fix please do not hesitate to call
I will return a fully executed original to you
We could file one before then as to non-Current Firm Shippers but I doubt we will
Any other questions -- let me know
If you would like a copy of the complaint let me know
Please see the attached and give your comments
I hope that this is helpful
If you have any comments please let me know
Barbara here is my draft of a rehearing request
In the meantime let me know if you have any comments
All other types of options will be generally available on a nondiscriminatory basis through our tariff
Let me know your comments as soon as possible
I tried to make my tone very pleasant and calm
I think you should start keeping this stuff now
If you have any other suggestions Susan's phone number is below
Again they are still considering whether or not they will make this filing
I am also forwarding this to Dan McFearin Manager of Transportation Services
If you do not hear from Jay you can check with Dan
I have made changes to the document
That is correct I returned comments to Accounting not AA directly
I don't think I sent my comments to Drew but I don't remember very clearly
That is pretty much all we needed for now Susan
You mentioned you sent comments to someone at AA
Also do you send your comments to Drew as well
If you need to see my comments I believe I kept a hard copy in my file
Right now we are in the midst of several internal control reviews related to various risk areas

American is slightly lower but you have to go THRU MIAMI
Scoop up the clumps after she goes
Both of you like to read study observe learn and teach
Travel is part of the glue that holds you together
Each of you is such a wanderer somebody might not come back -- or remain at home
And I would miss you while you were gone
Since every Saj is equal parts idealist and gambler your relationship should be very interesting
Please provide comments as you see fit
Denise please put these meetings on my calendar
I will let you know when conflicts arise
My understanding is that FERC does not yet require electronic contracting but that many pipelines do offer it voluntarily
Hi,...did I guess correctly as to your e-mail addresses
I'll watch to see whether it appears on the Commission's agenda
I have made some changes but need your approval
Please advise if you need anything
Ted I made one addition
So good to see you this weekend
I can see why you are so crazy about him
I can't believe I am still here at work
I know this is a bit unusual
Call if you have questions or need anything
I don't know if it will flow yet
Janet can you open the attachment
I am attaching it
Try to get them to agree to Texas law
I will follow up with Mark and provide you with a copy of the filing
Hope things went really well for you last week/end
If the attached is acceptable to you please print it out and sign it and return it to me
Easygoing and independent these two are compatible when it comes to balancing personal interests
They've never known jealousy and each partner keeps busy with personal projects when not with their lover
When they are together however they do all they can toward pleasing their partner and satiating common interests
Although they are adaptable and modern they can at times fly off the handle
However it is not in the Archer's nature to hold a grudge or let disagreements fester very long
They must be mindful of over-indulgences as such gluttony will only distract them
Their charm and charisma make them a very pleasant couple not only to one another but the entire crowd
Demetrius what I nice e-mail
It was great to see you too
I hope you have a happy Thanksgiving
Susan What a nice surprise seeing you the other evening in Houston
As we briefly discussed I'm in the Firm's Houston office almost weekly working on client matters and client development
Are you around/available
I should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon
Are you still having a great time
Really though I think I would much rather be in Bali
Does anyone know this person or his organization
Is this something our membership might be interested in
Since I did not hear back from you I assume that EBA was not interested
We couldn't guarantee you a slot even if you proposed a session was that an issue
How do you tactfully advise your coworkers about corporate etiquette
Jeff do you have the information for the rate
As to your question about what's going on in California I've done some reading and here are my thoughts
I have a conf
Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above
I feel as if I've really been chasing my tail here
I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now
Might be worth it to us though
After all we do have authority to charge negotiated rates
Have either of you seen anything to the contrary
Please call me so we can talk for a few minutes
Why don't we choose a venue somewhere between Duke and downtown
I go this email as well
Unfortunately I've been busy as well and didn't really look at it
As for future matters what will be our involvement for EBA-Houston events
Also I'm having someone come clean the place so you needn't worry about it in case you were wondering
Remember I have water covered
Call or e-mail if you have questions
Do we use her
What is her status and relationship with the pipeline group
Do you get any reports from Tom Rutherford on New Mexico
Frazier tells me he's available
Date time and either of those places are fine with me subject to Frazier's availability
And Craig will join us I'm sure
Please stay over at my place that night
She is back home now and begging me not to make the trip to Austin
Sounds like she is feeling a lot better
Heard you were sick
May I forward to MKM and Drew
Would you be availabile on Tuesday to discuss this
I assume in our case it would be firm transportation service
Do we want to file a response to PNM's protest
Any further questions let me know
Well I have definitely taken a turn for the worse -- lots of drainage and coughing up green/yellow stuff
I will hold off on the bathtub spa for Mema
Will stick to my pedicure gift certificate idea
So glad you are doing better
Specifically he has asked if ETS can assemble a description of such provisions for the pipes delivering to Calif
Do you guys have any materials explaining these provisions
We will form a questionnaire tailored to your group's needs
If they have these traits they have used them in the past
How do they accept criticism and/or reprimands
Lastly they must have an entrepreneurial focus
Do you have any candidates in the near future
We would be glad to help you with interviewing tips
Apparently they now have more people than they know what to do with so none of us are needed
Please get your bullets in tomorrow in the morning
I also like Enable
That is really the only information she still needs from us I think
Do you know what this annuity is related to
But Laura was right Lisa is currently my social planner - how scarey is that
So far it has been overwhelmingly positive
I really can't wait to get us all together
I know Kelly usually checks her email but I am not sure about Sarah
If anyone has a number for her-let me know
Let me know what ya'll think
Katie has got me thinking about traveling
I would love to talk to her more about different options
I can't wait to hear the stories
You guys can't get enough of me
Please see below for your new work location
If you have any questions please contact your group Assistant
It's compensation for poor self-esteem...Oh wait I don't have poor self-esteem - You're right Big Ego
You planned that didn't you
How's your week been going
Glad to hear things are going well with you
So what's new with you
Have you moved
Anyway I completely understand the urge to try something new
I would actually love to go if there was a job with Enron there that interested me
As for my dating life it is relatively unchanged
It was so good seeing you when I was in Houston
I'm glad to hear your enjoying work
Are you happy to be back in Houston
Do you still talk to Emily
I'm trying to decide right now where I want to live
I have the flexibility with my job to live wherever I choose so I've been thinking about LA
I'm torn though b/c I like Houston too
What else is going on with you
Are you dating any one
Do you still keep in touch with any Kappas
Well sorry for all the questions but I can't wait to hear from you...hopefully we can stay in touch
I really like your monosyllabic choices for names Kyle and Quinn
Who knows she might turn out to be more of a Gladys
The landscapers are almost finished with my yard
Try to take it easy
Needless to say we love all the stuff you gave us
I am enjoying the knives - what a difference they make
I feel creaky and it hurts to walk
De-add in your Exotica
I tried to explain the pricing formula in non-technical format
Let me know it you have any questions
Would you please forward the current spreadsheet with exotics
The documents and contracts seem pretty old which is why I assume no one has missed them
I tried calling you with the number but I never got an answer
Things around here have been absolutely crazy as I'm sure they have been for you
Actually I can do that regardless if you don't mind
Well how does it feel to be back
I am so excited to be coming out there - -
I really need a break from Houston...not to mention work.
Anyway I was just wondering what you think about the various options
Let me know and I'll try and book this thing today
Can we travel can we go
Can we go to a show
Should we visit our family each
Should we hang out on a beach
I will book it you will see
I will book it for you and me
Why To give you the Freedom to move about the country
Could you email me your father's full name
I hope your Monday is going well
My condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright
Well I mustered the courage to start my bathroom painting project yesterday
I chose a medium blue that looks very nice
Guess who helped me
Tonight I will finish the tub area which needed some repair/caulking/spackling
Now I am anxious to do the bedroom but probably will not get to it until next month
If I decide to paint any of the downstairs I believe I will entrust that work to the professionals
Since Bill seems to genuinely enjoy dance I invited him
So that leaves us with one ticket
Hope your weekend project was a success
It was very small and petty of me but I couldn't resist
Sorry it took me so long to get back to you
Are you getting a handle on the whole macro thing
As for myself and all of the guy juggling I'm trying to get that under control
Truth be told none of them are worth a dime
Let me know about the times
I just wanted to drop a line and see how work your new apartment/roommate and Brendan are all doing
All are wonderful I hope
Have a great holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon
I've really missed you guys these last few weeks
Hopefully we can all get together and go out or hit steak night for some cold ones
Because I actually have made some progress regarding London
Any new guys on the scene--doing their 'courting'
So Nick has some big news that I think would only be right for you to hear from him
Hopre you are well
I'll call you when I get into town
Glad to hear things are still well with you
I'm pretty much over it though
You will be seing me soon in Houston
So what is up with you
I lost his address
If you push the stick forward the houses get bigger
When in doubt hold on to your altitude
A 'good' landing is one from which you can walk away
Hey I'll try and give you a call tonight at your flat
I can't remember where your favorite ones are but where ever they may be the drinks are on me
Just let me know the time and place
I feel like I haven't seen you guys in forever
I definitely want to renew but as you know I never get home before the leasing office closes
If we renew we can get our carpet cleaned for free I THINK
Not your usual happy hour
As usual I would love to meet you guys next Thursday and plan on doing so
However I do reserve the right to bail last minute due to work
In that case maybe we can meet up some other time
The book code does not change month to month it is always XZP
If you don't like it let me know
Let me know if this does not agree with your intent
Please call me with your comments and let me know how you would like to proceed
However if Friday's the only time you can do it then Friday it is
Have any of you hear anything about it
Anyway hope things are going well for you and Clay
Susie-just wanted to say hello and see how your trip went
Hope you had a ball
I received your first message
If there are spaces available I would like to add my name to the list of attendants
Also I've filled out the remainder of the login and password file for my information
I am merely the messenger
They said they would mull it over at least
Steve has already told me it is OK with him
As for the good-bye I would have to give it high marks as well
Anyway if you could let me know about the detailing I would appreciate it
As for New Year's Eve I have to say I'm kind of with Kasey
Did you at least catch up a little on your rest
I just thought something needed to be said about wednesday
I don't like that solution
I really regret that decision right about now
Funny thing is I'm not really interested in any of them just having fun
Hope all well with you
So...Can you cover me for one night next week
Here's the summary we sent you before with new reference to Hector in redlining
I don't want to stop being nice but I think it gets me into trouble
I'll screen for you
Don't get me wrong I am drinking on the w/e's
Unfortunately I am not meeting the TX & CA women type
I have been AOL-IMing him
As for myself I'm doing pretty good these days
I'll buy you one
Anyway thought you'd like to now you're definitely making a name for yourself around here
Hope things are going well with you
I believe this email was intended for you
Thank you Susan Scott Don't forget to RSVP
Thank you and see you there
I do not believe it creates a negotiated rates issue
It is important that we work something out with Phillips today
I would be glad to help out in any capacity
If you need me to give you an overview of the system please call me
Are you willing -- or not
See you this weekend
Well I guess I made an impression
But life of privilege was not for me
After getting my high school diploma I took a job in a hot dirty textile mill
You may have heard of it -- the Rolling Stones
But there was a war going on and I felt I had to serve my country
So I enlisted in the U S Army and went to Vietnam
When I got back I took a long journey across this great land of ours
And in my spare time I invented the Internet
Why didn't I think of that
Any time it rains we have standing water for several days afterwards
Any information you can provide would be appreciated
Mom said you guys had a great time in China
I hope you took lots of pictures
So I'm going to see if there's a way I could come over next spring
I mean honestly what goes through these guys heads
I am definitely interested in the parking space at the Met
I love this place
To answer your question yes I am definitely suffering withdrawal
This made me laugh hard
This will be sent to everyone and their dog at Enron
Surprise surprise he didn't have many supportive words for Ted as dating material either
Regardless I'm still glad I dated him and think I learned a lot from the whole situation
I hope we can all make it
PS - I think you're right about the California men
Although I still think Ted takes the cake
Em you know I'm in on this one
Anyway I'm so glad I got the chance to see all of you while I was in London
Our thoughts deeds and words return to us sooner or later with astounding accuracy
Emily and I spent all day Sunday gallivanting around the city to the markets etc
I took pictures but most of them where taken inside pubs so who knows how they'll turn out
Hello my friend
First how was your trip
Secondly did you get many pictures
Let me know if either of you need anything else
Paul This new CP was pending you
Any ideas who it is
Here you go Cynthia
I feel pretty confident that everything is correct this month
However I'm sure I'm being overly optimistic on that front so call or email me with any changes
Hopefully I'll get a chance to see you then
But you know I'm not really sure
Here's the address for you
I don't actually leave until Thursday but I am VERY ready and equally excited
Anyway I'll forward you the email I sent Emily regarding the evening in question
Hope everything's good with you
Well we met and had dinner last night
I am very excited about my trip to London
I can't wait to see you guys
I went to the game Saturday with Travis Corey Mike and a friend of his
I lazed around the house enjoying both yesterday morning
So it was a good birthday
I meant to call you yesterday but somehow I never did
Hope you will accept a late Happy Birthday from me
Anyway I hope that you had a good day and that Bill took you out for a nice dinner
Good to have it done
Other questions -- let me know
Hope you got everything you needed to accomplished this weekend
Are you and Doug going to OU
Did I mention I really need this vacation
Anyway I have a couple of questions for you
Also do you have any predictions for the weather
I always end up over-packing but I'm really going to try to pare down
Obviously we are running on a tight time line
Once your attendance is confirmed details will follow
I know it's short notice but I would love to see you at some point while I'm over there
Let me know if you want to grab coffee a drink etc
Talk to you soon Jen
If you guys do end up going have a great time
Ashlea is right it was amazing
I hope that everyone can be there
So I met him for dinner Thursday night
Therefore telling him about the shirt was right in character for me
I am a confident probably too much so and well-adjusted individual
Does Chuck think less of me for being duped
Here's my request for rehearing so far
In the meantime I would appreciate your comments
I know that everyone says that but in my observation it has been true
I'm glad you at least got to say your toughts
I can't believe you told him about the t-shirt
Oh well what did you have to lose by getting it all out there
I'm glad your questions are answered now
I guess you'll just have to keep going to Steak Night
Do your best to maintain peace and tranquility instead of giving into resentment or suspicion
Someone may place their trust or future in your custody
Make them glad they did
You never lost this chance but may have temporarily misplaced it
You could be sitting on a virgin diamond mine
Later today you and a partner or advisor may clash
I have booked the trades below into the ENA system
Alas there is no point to steak night without Kori or myself
There is good cause for your lack of enthusiasm
As for the week after next anything from Wednesday night on will work for me
By-the-way not next week but the following week I will be back
I think I am getting old
So when are we going to have a chance to chat
I just faxed a copy of the ticket to you
Please let me know if it transmitted properly
You forget that I also studied French mon amie
I may not be able to write it any more but I can still read it
I mean really nice not just pretending
I think this is for you
Are you available anytime soon
Next week I will be out of the office Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday
I haven't done anything as of yet
If so I'd love to know what you think about the whole situation
If not let me know and I will resend the emails
Hopefully you are now in possession of a phone
I do not believe any changes are necessary there either
Just let me know the location
Face your situation and create something wonderful
Cancer it is time for change
Once you know the score you no longer feel threatened or disrespected
Sorry I didn't respond very promptly to your last email
Things have been very emotionally draining for me around here
Anyway Kevin saw me and came over to chat
He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms etc
When I said no I think he was genuinely disappointed
Kevin told me I was better-off without Ted
So when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted/Kevin's table to say good-bye to Kevin
Needless to say I was very hung over today
And no there is no way he could weasel his way back in to my good graces
Now on to a fun subject my trip to London
I'm very excited about the trip I really need to get out of Houston
I leave the activities in your capable hands
I haven't contacted him yet...what do you think
I tell ya Mo it's weird
Issues that have bogged you down are effectively addressed
Be direct and honest without losing your temper
Even if others misbehave continue pursuing what you believe is right
There can be no hostility on your end or negotiations will break down
Well what do you think
I am very new to this whole relationship discussion thing
I think ultimately regardless of the outcome it will make me a stronger person
By the way we will definitely cover the past relationships during this chat that is a given
Mom said she was keeping you up to date on everything
Right now I don't know if there is
What a coward that he had to e mail you and didn't even have the decency to call you
But yes it is definitely his loss
I'm am very excited about my trip to London
Plus in November I'm going to visit my brother and his wife in South Korea which should be interesting
What time are you heading out today
So do we know if Pat Fitzgerald is single
Sorry I didn't respond to your email yesterday
I will be glad when all of this is over
The jury is split on what you should do
Actually in practice I usually combine these tactics
Remember when Michael Stockton was so rude to me freshman year
Isn't he a little old to be living in the closet
I have confirmations from Ben Sunil and Rudi
Is there anyone else I left off the email
Or I may just see you at the office
That actually made me cry
Not that I ever need an excuse to enjoy good company steak beer etc
Besides given the absolutely beautiful weather we are currently enjoying the picnic tables and deck are beckoning
I don't have phone #'s etc
Please forward it to me when you get a chance
Steve and Frank I would be very interested in your comments on the attached
Hey evidently I'm not the only one slacking on the emails - That means you Em
I'm actually kind of glad he took this week long vacation...that whole out-of-sight out-of-mind theory really works
See you guys then
Some of you will be asked to do presentations many will not
This is simply for your information
What's stopping you
Hope you had a good time at the game this weekend despite the heat
If you do just let me know what day and time work best for you
Don't worry about me though
I will be patient and remain optimistic despite let downs
And in no way shape or form will I settle and end up with some dush
You will be happy to know however that I do have a good support system in Monique
Take a look and think about whether it would be wise to do more selling in the first paragraph
With your permission I will forward this to Mr Dasovich also
Anyway I wanted to touch base with you regarding my visit to London
Glad you liked the quote it does provide a good chuckle
Unfortunately I will not be able to participate
Keep me posted for the weeks ahead
Love the quote--and I agree whole-heartedly
If it looks like 'a go' I'll shoot everyone a follow-up email complete with ETA
Oh well it was definitely fun while things were going well so I suppose I should focus on that
But enough about me...So how are things with you guys
Dont'cha love it
Honestly I think my odds are pretty good
Glad to hear everything with you is going so well not that I'm surprised
Now I just don't know
Hope your move into the new apartment went well
When I got in I of course immediately checked my email...nothing
An incident with a love partner throws you for a loop causing a bit of deja-vu
For some reason I can't find the counterparty in the system
But let me know when you would be able to set these up
First things first I got the personality test...very interesting
I took it twice
So here we are or rather here I am in Houston...alone
And speaking of Matt no I haven't heard a thing from the turn-coat
Get back to me with anything...I'm desperate for positive energy
So I don't think this deal has anything to do with the Canada office
Is it possible it was changed by mistake to ECC
Don't let hurt feelings prevent you from making a new start
I think we have a winner
Wit makes its own welcome and levels all distinctions
Thanks again for thinking of me
Just let me know what day is best for you
I will let you know when I have extra tickets
I cannot believe you ran into Ben Affleck
I had an absolutely incredible time in San Diego with Julie
All in all it was an extremely relaxing weekend
So I got back to work today Wednesday and still no word from Mr Noble
Are you still alive
How are things with you and Wonder Boy
Drop a note when you get a chance
I haven't sent a quote in quite some time but this one really spoke to me
I think Ted needs to read this
No horse gets anywhere until he is harnessed
No stream or gas drives anything until it is confined
No life ever grows great until it is focused dedicated disciplined
I got a good chuckle out of it
Well they were in my locker at the Met which of course is closed at this point
So I stay at Darren and sleep on his couch
So being a guy I take the alarm completely out of the wall with my leatherman tool
My suggestion is that we work through Ms Katz initially
Glad to hear that you arrived safely in your new home
Thought I'd let you see the last email exchange between Mr Noble and myself
I would love to hear your insight on it all
Here's my thought at this point
Realizing this I'm not sure exactly how I feel about it - - - Any thoughts
I think the story below is funny
I thought you'd really like the one in blue
If we don't and the replacement shipper uses an alt
I haven't forgotten that I still owe you a birthday beer
I have highlighted the ones that have not be granted
Please let me know if you have any information on these
Do we need to talk
Everything you have mentioned up to this point sounds incredible
I would love to see the symphony got to a polo match or the races etc
I'm so excited for your visit this weekend
Which of these interests you
I've missed our shopping binges
This one kind of gives you that warm fuzzy feeling inside
What does your heart want for your second wish
Enjoy your new life
However I do have a couple of questions/concerns
Well this may go down as one of my absolute worst weeks ever
Hope you had a great birthday
Sorry I couldn't make it for cake last night
I had to work late last night...Big Shock
Anyway hope it was fun and that you're having a great week
I'm not real sure what I'm going to do about it but I'm sure I'll think of something
Fly me to the moon
Have you tried Susan Scott
Same dude...and he is good
Also I just sent him a list of all the UT games so he can start planning to attend
If you need more info let's talk
In one sense it's great but it also makes things a lot harder to read
Hopefully if we're still dating come December you and Chuck can meet him when you come back to visit
Needless to say I am very excited
Are you really
Would you come with your parents or separately
We'll do whatever you want want if you still are coming
The play was very good and I think well received
Anyway I'm sure I'd mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl
I know I need some of your organizational skills
Hopefully your week is starting off well
I know how much you love these spoofs so enjoy
Hope your having a good day or at least given the circumstances a tolerable one
Question If you could live forever would you and why
The researchers also discovered other similarities between the two but can't remember what they are
What I did was fail to comply with the law
If you're killed you've lost a very important part of your life
You know I was just teasing right
I actually do it when I am fortunate enough
As for the jokes I am very afraid and yet undaunted
I hope this helps and if you have any other questions just let me know you little hottie
I laughed I cried...it became a part of me
Honestly though it was a very funny flick
Evidently in order for us to actually watch a movie we have to physically go to the theatre
So do you think I should sport the leopard pants to the party
Look at you trying to bring me out of my shell
Don't let them work you too hard down there...remember your body's not used to it
Hopefully it is going well
I will make the reservations accordingly
As for the pick up the Sissy Crawford taxi is at your service
I think you had at one point asked me if the first U.T
Hope your day's going well
When I think about it that exception applies to every situation
By the way a maid service is coming to clean my place tomorrow afternoon
I completely understand your plight
Anyway I think a change of clothes prior to Steak Night is probably a good idea
Along those same lines what time did you want to head over there
We had a dozen eggs one time but when they hatched we only got ten live chicks
And the moral to this story is don't count your chickens until they're hatched
Still I think the one on this page best captures the kind of image you're looking to project
In his sock drawer you find pictures of women without bonnets
You come upon his secret stash of colorful socks
He's wearing his big black hat backwards
I assume Russ may be after something similar to the RRM
Actually my day is going very well
Anyway my roommate and I had already made plans for tonight but a movie tomorrow night sounds good
Just fill me in on the details
PS - I'll be purchasing my neon leopard-print cowboy hat shortly
As for the birthday shot you are quite welcome - it was the least I could do
After my expenditures over the holiday I will definitely be in town this weekend
As it stands right now I am having a very pleasant day and I hope you are as well
Hopefully you are having a good day and I'll talk to you later
Along those lines I had an absolutely incredible weekend
Funny thing is Ted that's his name walks by our table at the bar
Needless to say I was feeling pretty good
Appears to like/be close to his family
There are no plans as of yet but I will be sure to keep you informed of any progress
Write back soon and let me know how the apartment the job hunt and everything else is going
I heard you have seen a lot of him lately
They are right when they say it is exotic
Anyway we got to see and do some pretty interesting things and ate some really good food
I think that's why I like Steak Night so much
I am definitely up for a bucket of beer this week
Anyway it should be pretty good
Does that make sense to you
Compliments of your minion
Did you know
Are you satisfied with your job relationships and immediate future
Middle of the road choices won't do it for you
Change is rolling in on its own power now
I'll flag you down
However I would be more than happy to come down and pick up the check
Just let me know what works best for you
I have your paychecks
I will deliver
The elegance of your commentary has left me speechless
Could we just not say anything on those items
Look over and give me your feedback
I can see the attraction of Jane Austen's characters
May there always be work for your hands to do May your purse always hold a coin or two
May the sun always shine warm on your windowpane May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain
Do your best
Mediocrity is unacceptable when you are capable of doing better
Treat others as you want to be treated
Anyone else up for it
I must admit the job just keeps sounding better and better
Thanks for the compliment...that's a quality I like being associated with
I'm sure we can find you a ride over there
What time do you think you're going to be finished-up here
Are you still going to run
Can we meet briefly to discuss this
What time are you thinking about getting over there
I apologise for the delay in my response to your email
However I would appreciate the opportunity to learn more about your group and any possible future rotations
Who all would you like on your guest list for tomorrow
I may have to start training now for that
I feel as though I've said this a lot lately but...Congratulations
Also the step up position-wise is great and I think deserved
As far as being scared goes that'll be our little secret
Christine -- Here's a brief answer to your questions
In other words I think the Commission would see them as two separate kinds of service
In the meantime if your customers have questions I'll be happy to help answer them
Also I was trying to remember how much I covered of your meal the other night at Sabroso's
I promise I'm good for the money
Hope your having a wonderful day
I don't know how you reacted if you were upset etc
Regardless any friend of y'alls is a friend of mine
So are you going tonight or not
Also are you so bold as to suggest you've never lost
I would really appreciate your help
See my changes on the attached
I am well aware of the sensitivity of the subject
Believe it or not sometimes I am able to keep my mouth shut
Ginger I would very much like to participate in the meeting this Thursday
However given that it is bid-week I cannot absolutely guarantee my attendance
Please let me know if you are able to participate
And believe me I am making efforts to enlist worthy participants
Who's picking on me
I'm not going to take any lip from you
What kind of time frame are we looking at
Unless you catch your foot in a bear trap nothing can stop you
People are fascinated by your mind wit ideas and conversation
You're not the same person you were even a year ago
You understand more about yourself
Still think we should take Ben out for a dink tomorrow unless you have a date
Congratulations and yes you did
As for myself I'm doing well
Also when do you make the Big Move
I was remiss in excluding y'all from the original distribution
I know you're in the final stretch of the bet however this just might be cause for a loss
Let me know Thanks a bunch
Don't you mean no more
In addition we had them administer certain remaining gas purchase contracts as well as our de minimus sales function
All Amgas does today is administer our sales function
Has it ever approved similar small-volume waivers
Sorry for the delayed response I got really busy Friday afternoon and didn't check my email before I left
Congratulations on your wedding day
I must admit you brought Religion in my life
If I get only one thing for Christmas I hope it's your sister
As you grow older Mom I think of all the gifts you've given me
Thanks for being a part of my life
Youll probably need it again
Someday I hope to get married but not to you
You look great for your age...Almost Lifelike
When we were together you always said you'd die for me
I'm so miserable without you its almost like you're here
Congratulations on your new bundle of joy
I'd miss you heaps and think of you often
Are there any rate case implications I should be aware of
This was one of the emails I told you about
Supposedly you were slamming them back last night
Please include me on the volunteer e-mail list
Many of us already volunteer individually
I literally had tears in my eyes reading this one
I send them off to purchase Sprites so that we may consume their vodka
In my haste to avoid the usher I have lostmy bearings
Just wanted to share this thought with all of you
Sorry I forgot to include you in the last email
Hope to see you tonight
Thus our evening out is on
Besides most of you would probably put good money down on my being there until closing
Wilson my most heartfelt apologies
Barring weather issues it would appear as though we are on for Little Woodrow's tonight
Should we be rained out an alternative location will be chosen
If you get stumped I'd be happy to offer some suggestions
And do they have Ichiban beer
Depending on everyone's preferences I have several suggestions
You had Sea Wees in your bath tub
Your sleeping bag was your most prized possession
You wanted your first kiss to be at the roller rink
Are you there God
It's me Margaret
Friendship pins which you wore on your tennis shoes
Although I'm not sure about the Dalai Lama comment as he does believe in a power higher than himself
I am still measuring my powers
As far as tasting the fruits of my passion you know what they say...the first bite is the sweetest
Given all of this I am very happy
First and foremost you are a father then a husband and then a poet
Thanks for still including me in the distribution it makes me feel important
However as I have moved out of the controls group it probably isn't necessary to include me any longer
As you will note from the email address my last name is Scott
If it get books tonight we'll be able to pool it on Monday
Please don't think less of me as a person but this really made me laugh
You will be instructed on how to use it shortly
Stay home the two days of the year it snows
If you do run your car into a ditch don't panic
Don't try to help them
Just stay out of their way
This is what they live for
Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone
They don't understand you either
These are likely the last words he will ever say or worse still that you will ever hear
If it can't be fried in bacon grease it ain't worth cooking let alone eating
It does not matter if you need anything from the store
I think I had too much nectar last night
Wilson I treasure your NY attitude
I think everyone has a different definition of good some more lenient some more stringent
At least that has been my experience
Its funny you mentioned the Astros game
At present no one has been removed from the distribution but it is undergoing an audit
Lorraine here's what we would have to show FERC along with some of my comments
Which would come first our deal with PNM or with our shipper
Are you experiencing some sort of split personality today
Not to make a nuisance out of myself
Please get back to me as soon as possible
I will appreciate any help you can give
It is currently IF-ELPO/SANJUAN which we don't currently use
In the hospital the relatives gathered in the waiting room where their family member lays gravely ill
The family members sat silent as they absorbed the news

Every cut I hear from it on KPFT is so good
I heard about it on KPFT and it is awesome
The scary thing is I don't think he was kidding

Aren't we a poor sport
Here are my comments spice girl
Still I do appreciate your remembering that I am a lady
Sorry I'm just giving you a hard time
Please let me know if my behavior was inappropriate
Yes it was
It was not meant as an implication but rather a reiteration of mind-sets expressed to me on multiple occasions
The woman brushed herself off
Dart you can take me off the email distribution list now that I've left the risk controls group
I spent much of this weekend thinking the exact same thing
And Emily Katy and myself went to Tin Hall Saturday night to see Earl Thomas Connally
It renewed my faith in the opposite sex
Disclaimer I do not like forwards
Hopefully we can make this one
I heard through the grapevine you went the other weekend
Do you honestly think Tobin can be a substitute for you
Tobin Carlson will assist you in my absence
We got to talking about you at lunch today
In fact the true altruist hopes only that his acts benefit those to which they are directed
I will make sure you both receive my next brilliant composition
Good luck with everything it has been great working with you
I really don't know what to say about the email
But we don't so I'll just have to enjoy it solo
It's the life in your years
I would never ignore you on purpose
I'll call Ms Lee and give her the correct info
Can you please reply to this person
I am resubmitting my request for information
May I please hear from you as soon as possible
Please send any comments you have to me
Here is a last draft of our GPG rehearing comments
Thanks for the update it is good to hear from you
It is tough being a baby I think
I think the daycare arrangement is generally best for everyone
Most everyone I know is raising their kids that way and they seem to be turning out fine
Thank God she can never remember their names or she might start calling them for lunch
A lot of it is really over the top but I've seen some cool things there
I don't wanna FERC I just want to bang on the drum all day
Do you have the form of discount letter too
If so please send it
If there is a problem with the current arrangement we should discuss it
Yes we did revise the language
I think it should make no difference
No FERC staffer ever remembers what happens and the added pages will make your pleading really impressive
Drop me a line and let me know what's up
When you get a chance tell me again what your schedule is for the end of April through July
Just got the email myself...will definitely check it out
If there are contracts missing from the above list please include them in the packet as well
As for dinner I just emailed Katy and asked for her preference
I called and we are set for tomorrow night
Are we going to try to dinner before after or middle depending on how exciting it it
Transferring the tickets to my name etc
Of course dinner doesn't have to factor in at all if we don't want it to...just a suggestion
I'll give you call later tonight to hammer out the details
Lite refreshments Cash Bar Please come as you are
Participate where you can
Feel free to bring along your friends and family to volunteer too
Join us at Greenspoint Mall for a basketball-crazed atmosphere

I am up for driving Friday morning
I can't wait to catch up wich choo
I can't wait till next weekend it's going to be so much fun...can you believe it's almost here
Hopefully you got your itinerary in the mail
I am understandably very excited
I guess you leave tomorrow for your little trip
I am so jealous
But if anyone deserves it it's you
Anyway I am excited about next Tuesday
Talk to you Sunday or Monday
I promise to be well rested and ready to shop eat and go out...or just sit on the beach
Like I said before I'm up for anything
Hope things are going well with you the job and Brendan

If I don't talk to you tonight have a great time in The Caymans
What pray tell will she do
Cracks me up
I know I know
It's still weird to me
That's not to say I would but I'd still have to question the lack of desire to do so
I just get squeamish watching people cuddle so much
It's not a pleasant memory trust me
Sounds like it might be interesting to me
I'm still up for this evening if you are
You me Mucky Duck
Do you know how much it costs
I simply do not understand
I just think it's weird
Good luck to you as well in your own endeavors
I think you can skip Deborah's wedding
I don't really know
Of course I won't be working all day everyday so we could do dinner a movie etc
I don't want to encourage you not to go to Deborah's wedding but frankly I am all weddinged out
Have you made plans to go with anyone
Nothing for you this month Kori
Although considering the amount of money the company has sunk into her it may have been a homing device
I'll give you a call later to discuss
FYI Trish Murphy is playing at the Mucky Duck tomorrow night...thought you might be interested
If you have exams papers etc
Have to agree with your assessment
She's in heat righ= t now I swear
Like I said it's = pitiful
Perfect combo for our Ms Gillette
Can you believe my parents
I'll work on the trip thing...the timing sounds good to me
Tried to call you last night but to no avail
Know that you were out having fun
Mom came to San Diego and we took some pix
Stop by if you have any questions
I believe this message was intended for the other Susan Scott
I would try my hardest but I just don't think I would be very much fun
However I would love to talk about Vegas
I've been wondering about it because I thought you sounded funny
Maybe you were just tired
Can you help map these
Please let me know if you would like the order
Sometimes we like to have EPSA file then Enron may not need to file
Therefore typically you wouldn't need to be on this call but I think you should listen in to learn
Again let me know if there is anything else I can do to help you
No problem...it makes me feel important
Hey girls...I hate this but I may be out Thursday
I think Aries is the one- event though it is $$$
I'll send the e-vite after I get a few approvals
Any chance either or both of you could get together this week for coffee dinner ice cream etc.
Also are you all going to Deborah's wedding
Thank you so much for helping me out Friday night
Susan Can you still stop by before you leave today pls

I look forward to the day
I hope that you are all having a great week
Have a wonderful day and I will talk to you soon

What can I do to have these checks reissued
What can she do to have these checks reissued
Who handles the expense checks is that you
I forgot to stop by to say hello
I wonder how many women he's stringing along
Thought I'd drop you a line and catch up on life
I tell you it's out-of-control with all of my friend's weddings & engagements
I am very rapidly becoming out-numbered on this front
September is also an option if that works better for you
I told her I sent it to him
By the way do we have a particular time in mind
Well I feel like I missed out on a lot last Friday hence the get together tonight

Susan Could you or someone else be on the lookout for FE's tariff filings in compliance with this order

As for the lease brought up the subject and it went pretty much no where

Wish you all the best
I just talked to Leslie and we decided to go to dinner together

Well there's the turbulence in my world-- how's yours
I'll bet it does belong to the other Susan
I've never signed you up for Cingular Wireless
If I have any trouble I'll let you know
Have you had any trouble getting my PrimeCO bills processed
Did you order any service for me from Cingular
Let me know if this isn't the case
Susan is this for you
Anyway wanted to let you know and see if you had any interest
Emily Katy myself and possibly Lisa are talking about making a trip up there tomorrow
As for this evening I think we're still on
If you do end up in Austin tomorrow night we'll have to try to get together
I would have to come back on Saturday though
I have never seen Pat Green and I really want to
It's been quite a while since we caught up on things
I went about a month ago and visited Emily in London and have been busy with work etc
Hope you had a good Fourth of July
It happens to me pretty regularly
So are you heading up to Austin today
Did you make it back to Cali or head to your new second home Austin
I hope all is well in gas trading land
I attach herewith a copy of the comments
As always if you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact us
Let me know if that sounds good or if there's som= e other weekend you had in mind
And I'm honored to be your shopping muse=
PS - The job's still good and I miss you too
I was thinking about you all weekend
Clint always asks abo= ut you too
Hope you had a good Fourth of July!
I know...I'm a peach
And we watched Crouching Tiger which I loved
You were right it is a very woman take charge film
That was nice of you to send a card
I worked until midnight last night-- it actually wasn't so bad
I was disappointed but relieved
FYI Bryan called last night to see if I wanted to go out again
Last night was good...a nice relaxed dinner suited me just right
So maybe Thursday or Friday night we could do something
If you get a chance send me Julie's e-mail
Is that her name
I guess I deleted it from my e-mails
I got Clay's message and thought I'd replied but obviously I forgot
Glad to hear things are good...even if they are hectic
Did you get that Katy
Just kidding...I'll see you guys at the apartment
How's married life treating you these days
I hope things are good with your job home etc
It looks like you may have changed jobs already which I trust is a good thing for you
If you could start thinking of suggestions for restaurants bars outdoor activities etc
It's so nice to hear from you
To that end we were thinking about doing some kayaking if you know of any particularly good places
I've been wondering if you were alive...sorry I missed your call last Thursday I was in a meeting
I'll email more later but just thought I'd give you a heads up
Anyway just drop me a note when you get a chance...I could definitely use a good chat session
As for me the trip was fantastic
The plane flight back was definitely not fun but I did survive
It reminded me of London quite a bit although I think the weather is milder
Oh well I'll console myself with the fact that I get to live in H-town...always lifts my spirits
I know I've thoroughly enjoyed all the commentary
Did I miss the meeting time
Before you know it we're gonna start outnumbering you guys
I feel okay...just regretting some of my actions from last night
Will you be able to compete still or are you just going to hit all the wine stops now
I think you're right about Katy's move to Dallas
I pretty sure the folks are still helping out with living expenses etc
As for me Seattle could definitely be a destination but it would require a job change
Once again...best of luck banging out your opus
I work in retail power in EES
I started working here at Enron a month ago
Hope things are good on your end
If you see Joel Bennett around tell him I said hi
Sorry I didn't call this weekend but I was swamped Saturday and subsequently exhausted on Sunday
Anyway I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for me
However if you leave on the following Sunday you'll be back into Houston Sunday
I will ask though
Shoot me a quick e mail if this is not ok
Otherwise I will plan on purchasing your tickets this afternoon
Great...sounds good to me
Can't wait to see you guys
I changed the time
I believe this was intended for the other Susan Scott
I just got a call from Susan Ginsberg at El Paso
Some friends were sitting at the bar talking about their professions
Thanks anyway...I eventually tracked it down yesterday
Emily's got the right idea avoid it at all costs
Still work's going all right for me
My hours have dramatically improved which is nice and they actually let me take time off for vacation
Hey Susan- I don't have Emily's number
I just started school today
I would love to see you in September in NB
Marathon runners we start bright and early tomorrow
Please wear this every Saturday morning on our training runs
I know what an overwhelming place this can be at times
If its not possible that's not a problem I understand its a busy time for everybody just about now
You're going to be so disappointed in us but we never ended up kayaking
It be great to see you again
I hope things are going great for you as well
Otherwise I would have loved to have gone
Do you remember Nathan Thomas
I thought you might be interested
Do I even know this guy or has someone yet again confused me with the other Susan Scott
Since your one of the only names on this thing I recognize besides Margaret's I thought I'd ask
His innate ability to make us laugh will be sorely missed
So in between the kleenex hugs and kisses we are going throw back a few drinks in his honor
So what are you up to tonight
Per our conversation I have put the following information together for you to distribute to individuals in EPMI
I know I know...I dropped off the face of the earth for a while
As for Labor Day weekend I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it
So issue one is will I have enough energy to make the trip
I'm going to visit my brother and his wife in S Korea so it should be interesting
Anyway just let me know...I won't make the full check out now if you want to split
Were you planning on going walking
Well no can say your life isn't exciting
Wow I can't wait to hear about it
I got your message Saturday
Thanks friend -- I HOPE to hear from you soon
See you at the wedding if not before
Just wanted to share the good news with all of you
We are leaving early that Sunday morning but Katy said she would get her own car that day
HI Susan- That's totally fine- I completely understand
Sounds like you have a lot of fun events coming up
Truly what purpose would it serve
As for my work situations they aren't that exciting but have made for some highly uncomfortable moments for me
I'll tell you about them on my next visit
See I've already come up with a reason why I have to come back out there
Fortunately my behavior was very short-lived and I completely recognized what I was doing
My guess is I won't be getting much sleep
All your friends are very cool
Say thanks to Clint for me if you get the chance
I hope you had a nice Easter
I've been wanting to call you but for some reason I can't find your phone number
I hope you're doing well and not having to work so so hard these days
I miss you and all the girls--we need a reunion soon
I can't believe I missed seeing y'all this weekend
I told y'all he got a new job right
He loves it
I would love to get together with y'all soon
Are you going to Austin for the game this weekend Susan
I called her yesterday and left a message
Let me know what y'all's plans are for this weekend
Sue-Sue We loved seeing you this weekend
I am catatonic today but it was a fun night
I love the bags and the figurines are adorable
The kids love their watches
I just had to strap Mack's on for bedtime
Thanks again and we'll see you in Austin or Houston soon
You know it is overcast
Fortunately my behavior was very short-lived = and I completely recognized what I was doing
We close on it two days after my arrival in London
Our move in date will be sometime next summer depending on our tenants' situation
He promised crossed his heart hoped to die and the whole bit
Finally we decided to call up a realtor and go see it
During the three week period I had a huge and slightly dramatic internal debate about living in this area
Was I deep-down really a total snob
If not would I become one
Would I have to go to the neighborhood Tom Thumb
Would I become my mother
After much prayer and consideration Clay and I put down a REALLY low-ball offer on the house
We negotiated for about a week and the sellers finally accepted our offer
We feel terribly blessed and our prayer is that our home can be put to use for God's purposes
I certainly deserve it
I will have email in London so shoot me one whenever possible
Much love and big hugs to you all
Best wishes to all of you
Well its been a very long time
Thankfull= y I had my good buddy Lenhart to pick me up from my deep depression
Oddly e= nough we got a ton of girls' phone numbers
Sue- Have you seen this
Thought you might get a kick out of it
Hey we just got word that all permanent change of station moves have been suspended
No word on when that may change but we will keep you posted
I hate forwards...but I do like champagne
Sounds like it was a doozey
Say they make the offer...what then
Are you in for tonight
Still this is a fairly involved decision for us and at present we are discussing a number of options
I'm being very serious it will not be safe for you to be there at all
I really hope you take my advice
That way I can spend more on food and drinks
As a precautionary measure however we have increased security in and around our facilities
We realize that as Enron conducts its business some air travel is unavoidable
If you are traveling by air allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures
Susan Let me know if you have any questions about these volumes
Personally I think this is a really good price
This article's pretty good and it does mention India in some context so I thought you might be interested
Thank you Susan
Will you send me your phone number
Really want to catch up with you
Let me know when is a good time to reach you- tonight maybe
Will you also send me your mailing address
Hope all is going well for you
I tried to contact Emily but alas she has not returned my call must be quite busy she is
Please don't mention this to Jennifer we want to keep it a surprise
Well we are still out at sea with little direction as to what our next priority is
We have seen the articles and the photographs and they are sickening
As they came even closer we saw that it was flying at half-mast
Are you sure you have the right Susan Scott
I haven't made any real decisions regarding my living situation
I wanted to find out about your job etc
I decided to go ahead and come in to the office
If you don't mind could you resend the response to this email account
Look forward to speaking with you again soon
Hope you had a good New Year
Hope you had a great New Year
You just have to tell me yeah or neah
I shouldn't have too much difficulty arranging travel but I wanted to run a few things by you first
I sent the note below today to your other email account
Alternatively if you book your own airfare and hotel we will reimburse you
Wanted to wish you a Happy New Year and let you know that I'm Seattle bound one more time
Let me know how your schedule is looking
I got your x-mas card...that was too cute
I knew I wanted to get that for you the second I saw it really too cool
Anyway I really just wanted to touch base and see how life's been treating you and your new hubby
Please send me your current addresses
I have free tickets and it may be Hakeem's last game
Hey Lisa...good to hear from you
I assume you didn't get the other email I sent
So I told her about my change in diet no caffeine no alcohol
She advised me to attack this cold...ie get rid of it soon..and immediately resume exercise...aerobic exercise in particular
So thats it
Good luck and let me know how it goes
I look forward to meeting and talking with you tomorrow
I apologize for sending a mass email
Therefore all of my future contact will most likely be through that email address
It is the caring that she lovingly gives The passion that she shows
Thank you Susan Scott ext
So if you could get back to me sometime before this afternoon that would be very helpful
The allocation process I do not think = is the problem
Thanks Ramona Regarding my meeting invitation...I hope this helps
In the future we may choose to change th= ose practices to one of the methods you recommended below
The individual purchase orders are not as convenient but they provide bet= ter clarity between the parties
I hope this email finds everyone well
And Steve actually said he was proud of me
Suz I'm using both addresses since I don't know which one is current
Did I tell you I'm off to Vegas this weekend
I love this job
I apologize for not returning your call sooner but I was actually out of town until yesterday
You have an e-Card waiting for you at Amazon.com
We hope you enjoy it
Need another way to view your e-Card
BTW...I'm celebrating my first quarter century today
Susan I have your email
Sorry I have not responded
Alas you are not forgotten however
I will write more thoroughly tomorrow
Sorry we didn't call last night
We'll call you tonight
Sorry we missed you last night
Sorry I missed your call last night...big shock I was in the bath-tub
Anyways you can definitely give me a call tonight if you'd like
I'm still working on a good time to visit so I'll keep you posted
Anyway I fly in Thursday and don't leave until Monday
The interview will be Friday much like my set-up last time
So if you're going to be in town we definitely have to get together
Hope you had an absolutely incredible honeymoon
I'm sure it was a blast
The reason I'm writing actually is because I left something at the church the night of the wedding
I know its a day late
Wish I were there to celebrate with you
Did you or are you doing anything exciting
I wanted to touch base with you regarding accommodations
Let me know which one sounds better to you
It's liberating knowing where you stand
The point is that your life circumstances and opportunities are finally able to break from free the ice
Welcome change as the liberating thing it truly is
Be very cautious about who you confide in
As you establish a new chapter in your life play your cards very close to your vest
I will not be mailing you tickets
Seriously I think I could find a lot of guys to be interested in there
Strapping physically fit beach boys with awesome dogs and a decent amount of world travel behind them
I liked that-- and I deinitely agree
Are you leaving for San Diego tomorrow
I am coming in town tomorrow but I bet I am going to miss you
Quick question are you in H-town this week or hanging out on the west coast
I would love a ride
Larry...I don't have a phone near by could you log on to messenger
I really think I'm supposed to be in Del Mar
Joe Parks told me to contact you
Are you down there now
Not all of them will need to be just the ones with positions
So we may need to touch base before starting
I was hoping to pick your brain a bit
On that front I was hoping to pick your brain a bit about a few things
To that extent I believe I could prove to be a valuable asset within any organization
Actually I flew out to San Diego Thursday night
Kathy I'm getting this to you as a heads-up
I have a while to make the decision
In the meantime I'm exploring every contact I can come up with
Keith...could you make this request
I believe the access will be temporary and it may be monitored
However they still need to shape and validate the curves
All other days we are still missing data on
When he did not show another call was put into him today
I have not heard back on the status but will check in the morning
I know it can be so frustrating
I apologize for not returning your call last night
You should be able to reach me today without any problems
So I wanted to let you know that Puget called me last Friday with another job opening
Anyway it was fun and very relaxing
Please check it
If you did not please let me know and I will resend the relevant information
Hope you have a happy Easter
If you're on the computer could you log into AOL
I don't have a phone near me to call you on we need to go over these curves
These individuals may now be with UBS but they should know who to contact on the estate side
I contacted Jeremy and Nilay
I am waiting for him to return my call
I'm in the office I'll call you
Hey guys...wanted to see what your availability is for this afternoon
I am busy this morning
What is your location again
Jacquelyn...I don't think this was intended for me
We then will fly you home later that day
Would this work for you
Actually I think the PWC guys will be contacting you to talk about the information they're hoping to locate
Do I need to do anything on this
Can you clarify the location please
Where do you sit
I couldn't agree more...Happy Holidays
Paul Harvey writes We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them worse
These things I wish for you through tough times and disappointment hard work and happiness
To me its the only way to appreciate life
Thank you Jacquelyn...I look forward to the trip

If there is anythin= g else you need from me please don't hesitate to ask
If you have any questions please do not hesi= tate to call
I would like to be placed in the new garage
In today's job market it seems ludicrous to talk about turning down a job offer
After four months of rejection he finally got an offer
Or was he
It really wasn't the job he wanted
The job really didn't match any of his values
Financially it was going to be a lateral move
But most of all it was not a challenging or growth-related opportunity
George was making himself sick thinking about the decision
That afternoon he happened to catch a television show about taking care of yourself in stressful times
George knew what he wanted to do
When he told his wife not only was she understanding but she was encouraging as well
Together they wrote a script to gracefully reject it
Today I'm going to San Francisco to meet my parents and Chelsea for Easter
I won't be back to LA until Monday afternoon
As always it's good to hear from you
She had a heart beat when she was born but it was very weak
So say a little prayer for them if you can
Take care and I'll talk to you soon
I've been interviewing and have a few offers but am not completely sure what I will be doing
I must admit though that an hour long massage sounds wonderful
I just left a message for you at work...How EXCITING
Susan- I hope that all is well
Let me know when you will be in Austin next
As Chair Herbert said SPP should have read the Commission's order in May and taken it more seriously
I arrive Thursday evening and don't leave again until Sunday afternoon
Either works for me
Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think
Benefits Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin
I'm checking out the L'Auberge website as we speak...it sounds wonderful
I always feel underdressed when I= go out here
Given those various situations I was wondering what you suggest I bring along
I know I know...I had way too much time on my hands yesterday
Needless to say it was a big night
Oh I am so glad to hear from you
Been thinking about you no not in that way
What are you up to this week
I love that place on Thursdays...wait I digress...I like the ladies on Thursdays there
I'll let you know if I hear anything back

Carol I missed this deal the other day which was originally assigned to Marie
In our last legal/credit meeting Brant was going to call Christina Tice the CP credit manager
Rod And what lawyer is handling this in your presence
They see the signing of the ISDA as a very simple process as they have several of them signed
Once you receive it pls

It will be identical to the CAPEX I believe
Rod pls provide your input to Sara on credit for Capsa considering the no threshold issue
If not please let me know and feel free to pass this message on to the appropriate attorney
I received your voice mail message this afternoon
Maybe they need commercial help to get the guaranty

Today is bad for me
Rod Daniel Goldhagen is their credit officer
Would you like to have a copy
Further to my voice-mail message please see below
Can you take a look at this for me please
They just sent me a huge agreement relating to their arrangement with the International Finance Corp and hedging agreements
I believe this to be true
We should talk to our Aquila trader
Also I need to speak with you about brokerage business - it's exceeding swap/derivative work
Also Randy Curry did call me yesterday but wasn't available when I returned the call
Could we please talk this afternoon about outstanding agreements
Per your recommendation I contacted Randy Curry President of Bridgeline and passed along your thoughts about Jason
God knows they need an attorney
Right now I think we can take this off the priority list
Please note that Vinay Dwarkadas is no longer working with us
Tanya Can you tell me what products we trade
Hope there's no confusion about my role in Brazil
This is the account we can begin working on now
Sara will be forwarding the documentation to you
Let me know if you want me to run it down
Call if you have immediate issues
Could you fax me your comments
Please let her know your availablity
It is possible that after due notice we will commence with the closure of unutilized account.s
I met with accounting regarding these amounts
I will be forwarding a copy to you
And obviously we will not have this done by Monday morning
Still waiting to hear from you
We would like to have our order go in before the weekend if possible
Since the Act prescribes prior approval we should sell only after receipt of RBI approval and not before
Since we intend selling at the floor this certification is not required
Hence it is advisable to check whether the shares of AEKE were thinly traded or not
In my view NoC would be a pre requisite
Since it is not a demated shares opening of an custodial account is not required
RBI while according its approval will look in to the transaction and accord approval for this as well
I hope this answers your question
Can't Canada trades be covered under our ISDA
PG&E told me that in order to trade with Canada they would have to trade through us
Can we please discuss
I am free all afternoon
Gary I believe we are having our guaranty executed
We haven't seen the draft of yours
How long will it take for you to execute
Looks like our counterparty did not have authority to transact
Please forgive me
It may be helpful for you to have a conversation with her about your goals etc
I am still handling financial derivatives matters in general for Mexico
If you require any further assistance please contact me
Yes my other question to Gary was HOW QUICKLY can you have the guaranty executed
I know Susan's schedule would work and mine as well,, Let me know
Please let me see the cover letter you submit to Lisa
If netting is not a concern then we can have separate and unrelated transactions
Are you going to push an ISDA for SITA

I have several thoughts on this section
Per my voice mail attached is the confirm
Can you spot any problems
Jeff Jeff as we discussed attached is the confirm for the forward
Sara this information is needed regarding the Assignments you are working on with Carol St Clair
Susan will you please handle
This has reference to our telecon
In addition the RBI requires certain documents which are detailed in the form itself
Any other information that you require please do not hesitate to get in touch
Paul I think you are trying to avoid me
Hope all is well and you are just overworked and overwhelmed
In connection with that group's activities I have some questions and all fingers point to you
Are they online
Should I just grab a password
Do we need to amend or create a new master
How do you monitor
Show this language to our Crude guys
I'm sorry - here you are
I have not received any language from you
Jeff Jeff In case you are not aware there is another attorney that assists Jaime with his trading business
Don't worry - I already spoke to Souad
How do I get in touch with you
Obviously it is better to have it in writing
A few other comments They say automatic early termination applies but I think that is a really bad idea
Please advise on how we should proceed on the guaranty issuance
If you have any comments or questions please forward to my attention so that we can proceed accordingly
I understand that you had a recent show of his work
I hope you are doing well and we look forward to returning to L.A soon
If so I've got copies of all that and can take it from here
Mark T /Janice Is there any particular law firm whom we should work with this time round
Kindly let us know on new developments

What I do plan to do is update historical info
Will we trade in a similar fashion in the future
If you disagree please let me know and I will try to rethink how to model this appropriately
Next week I will be in Brazil so maybe I can take this issue of my pending list

John will let us know tomorrow either way so we'll be in touch
In the meantime please let me or John know if you have any questions
I am not familiar with the frequency of our trades but I'm sure Laurel can fill in the blanks

Do you prefer that we continue on asking people for mutual agreement or are you o.k

Please contact me if you have any problems
I don't know where this stands

We plan on discussing the foregoing during our call tomorrow afternoon
Maybe you want to go to the meeting
Do you still require a copy
If so please advise your fax number
I was unable to locate it

I therefore also append that agreement to this message
Either works for me right now
When do you want to move this guaranty along
I am reviewing comments from our Tuesday meeting
Do you want to follow up with Koch
Or do you want legal to pursue
Guess what they want
I explained our financial trading entities
Why don't you call me

After - I feel like I'm suffocating
After - She called me a controlling manipulative egomaniac

Before - Is that all you are eating
After - Maybe you should just have a salad honey
After - Doesn't she have a mind of her own
Before - He's lost without me
After - Why can't he ask for directions
Before - I can hardly believe we found each other
I don't need anything further
Also thanks for your assistance last week and continued attention to our legal group
I can give you more details if you need them
She got a return receipt from you
Thanks - I'm sure glad one of us is thinking

Susan Looks like it worked
Can you please repsond to John's request
Kaye I think I returned this to you several weeks ago
Can I leave this in your hands

This looks as we agreed on the phone
I apologise for me being a little slow on the uptake
Maybe its unenforceable
Will you evaluate
I received your call
I have not heard from credit
There are two things that you can do in the meantime
I believe that you didn't know when we last spoke
As a practical matter I'm not sure whether we even transact with utilities on the omnibus
Do you have a few minutes today
As of now they do not transact with Enron in the physical markets but they may in the future
Please ignore my prior message
Mary Do you want to answer Laurel
I did hear that legal was currently reviewing this issue
Do you know where it stands or who the best person to contact about this would be
Sara It seems like we talked about this as part of a larger conversation on web-based confirms
Mark Where do we stand on this issue
Okay looks to me like Weyerhaueser wants us to act as their counsel
Also I thought we usually had assignability to affiliates so long as the guarantor remained the same
He wants to put it back in
I want it back in as well
Let's discuss this when you get a minute
He had some additional clarification he needed but these seemed to be the legal issues on his list

No I indicated that the assignment and account agreement were essential
I did not say that accompanying docs were not required
I suggested that someone should verify with Cheryl Lewis
Often the broker will rely on our relationship and subsequent delivery of accompanying docs
Re lotus notes however I certainly could be wrong
If you are certain please point out or forward
Understand this may still be in your legal dept
Ed have you had a chance to look over

Q I'm not a lawyer and I don't understand the recent Supreme Court decision in Bush v Gore
Can you explain it to me
I read it
Q I'll bet I know the reason
I heard Jim Baker say this
Q I thought the Florida Court was not allowed to change the Legislature's law after the election
Q So if the Court had adopted new standards I thought it would have been overturned
Q If the Court had adopted new standards it would have been overturned for changing the rules
And if it didn't it's overturned for not changing the rules
Across the nation we vote in a hodgepodge of systems
A They would have made it but the five conservative justices stopped the recount last Saturday
The US Supreme Court rejected it
A Yes when liberal judges are perceived to have done it
Q Tell me this Florida's laws are unconstitutional
Q So what do we do have a re-vote
Q Why didn't they recuse themselves
Q I can't believe the justices acted in such a blatantly political way
Q I thought in a democracy the guy with the most votes wins
Q What do I do now
Sorry to hear that you won't be joining us

We're working on a variation of it now
The best part is that we have just began
John is very anxious to talk to you
I would definitely like to have a ticket
If guests are invited I would love to have one additional ticket
It's the first picture you've sent that I did recognize anyone
He looks just like his son Jeffrey Jr in this picture
I never was able to open the document that was sent twice which I believe had all the details
We'll get him a corporate aircraft though so he can come and go as he pleases
At any rate if I could get the details for the party Friday night I would really appreciate it
See if you recognize anyone in the attached picture
It means nothing to me but will be happy to follow up on it if necessary
Please accept my apology for sending this email
This was for another employee and I selected the wrong person
I have penciled it in on his calendar as has Rebecca
We would like you and Rebecca to join us.
As you can see from our schedule we are pretty open
We really enjoyed seeing your centerfold photo the other month.
Could= you please resend
In any event I'm cleaning out our e-mail files and thought I'd pass it on to you
I went with them for two reasons
I need your new home address and telephone number
Please send at your convince
Thank you for setting aside time to meet with me
During these years I have done some of my best work
Now I feel it is time to move to a new chapter in my career
I found it during a profoundly challenging period in my life
Please include my name on the list of interested people
Susan the Real Time desk is trying to save a import schedule and we got this error
IF I AM READING THIS INCORRECTLY LET ME KNOW
If you are interested please e-mail me by Noon Wednesday at which time I will hold a drawing
I couldn't figure out any other way to do it while keeping everyone else's requests whole
It was two years ago january since I've seen you
If you want to email let me know
They will be able to contact me to answer your questions
THE NEW SCHEDULE IS OUT FOR JUNE I APOLOGIZE FOR THE IRREGULARITY
If anyone has conflicts let me know or trade where possible
We will miss them and wish them the best
Yesterday we lost several of our valuable employees
We appreciate their individual contributions and wish them the best
Please include these in the SAR when it is run
The name as it appears on the card is Matthew Smith
Well it wasn't that bad
Hey we need to talk
I can deal but its just kind of annoying
Did you get my card yet
Oh yes I had a good time although very exhausted from getting in late
I noticed some of my wine stash was depleted
Did you have anything to do with that
This is required for a special project for Phillip so it is high priority
Let me know if you need any further clarification of what I need but I think IT should know
Thanks for reminding me I was in the process of emailing you but I got distracted
Anyway it was working for Ken because he had someone's password coded into the file
Apparently I have all the necessary software as well
So I guess I could apply the model for that purpose
Anyway I wondering what you thought about drinks after work thursday and if you had any venue preference
I suppose I'll just keep waiting
You should now have checks from myself Duncan and Bill
Sharon said she would get back to me today but I think we should jump on this lodge asap
I finally got the other version to work but only by running it on Ken's computer
I thought Mark had called you but I guess not
Let me know if you have any suggestions
Yo sorry I haven't gotten back to you right away
I'll do some checking tonight and I'll let you know what I come up with
Anyway I just wanted to let you know I'm still considering
I asked you how often you check email but you've never told me once a day week what
I'll just tell everyone I have to work which I do anyway
It'll be my second to last weekend stint
I'm jealous about you being in NY
Have a drinky for me
Too bad you're away...I'm sure we could do well
As discussed I am forwarding to you two spreadsheets with the requested information
Unfortunately I've been extremely lame mostly because you got me sick...well maybe not
Anyway I haven't been feeling so hot yet I did oversleep by two hours this morning which really helped
I'll get you the required information next week
Definitely keep me informed though
Of course eventually we need to fix the model
If you would like any changes please mark up / edit and I'll make the changes today
I have consulted my partner and it would be great if we could be added to the reservation list
Ok gang - here's what I have so far for Sunday.
They won't seat us if we are all not there.
Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet
To be consistent though we should probably change the Test Sheet
If you pull from our spreadsheet then the latest numbers would not be in when this report is run
The numbers are close but we should compare our formulas because I don't think this is a cycle problem
As we discussed you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report
These notes should give us a great place to start
I look forward to getting this report ready to use
Unfortunately my trips are in limbo
Sorry Jeff and I went to happy hour
I told you I'd help
I was not out today
Yesterday and today I was taking a class
I'm sorry I didn't tell anyone it was a last minute decision
I think I'm going to the cookoff so I'm will have to decline
I'll have to think about it
I'd definitely be interested going out Sat. but I don't have any suggestions as of yet
I'll see what I can come up with
I don't know about the Rodeo
I haven't heard from you
Have you bought your Padre tickets
Anyway I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga
Are you out of a job yet
Still thinking of your neck of the woods
I want to know what its about
Do you have his pager number
As it stands right now don't count me in for dinner
I think my friends would like it but they're here seeing someone else as well
If I don't make it to dinner we'll definitely meet you guys out afterwards
Yo you about ready
I should be good for a place to say but I certainly appreciate the offer
Ya we tried meeting up but I guess you guys must have left before we got there
Hope you guys had a good time and I'm always up for another night out
Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat night but I guess we missed each other
Maybe we can try it again sometime soon
I took last week off and Phillip is out this week so I don't have much to do
Regardless any chance of digging them up for me
I may want to talk to them about their bid process
Oh I had fun as well
I'm glad you guys came
I went flying on Sunday too which was nice
Give me a call if you want to chat sometime
HOw's it goin
I think I was still a little looped the next morning
So did you have a fantastic weekend after we left
How did you avoid the freaks
Anyway I haven't tried it without the key but if you say it works then I'm sure it does
I'm free all week so let me know when and where if you want to get together
Hey thanks for returning my call
You may have provided these to Ken but I can't get in touch with him
Of course I knew that
The question is why were you calling him
Did you know Dave doesn't work for Pirnie anymore
I just tried calling him & the receptionist told me that
I will look at it later today
Have you had a chance to look at my resume
Look at it and let me know what you think
So I guess just keep me posted
So where the hell was it
Hey fucko give me a call
I am trying to get these done soon so please respond to me ASAP
Once again I was out when you sent me mail
I went to NYC for a long weekend
If you get back before the weekend drop me an email
Matt- I don't know if you remember me but we met at Jennifer's party at the Black Lab
For your information the attached table provides the additional items
Please let me know if you have any questions/comments
Charles just got a phone call for you
Apparently his phone number is listed in the directory for you
Since I didn't remember your number we told the guy we'd pass on his name and number
Those frozen screwdrivers will fuck you up
No partying for me tonight
Dad told about you changing the ticket but thanks
I turn and the flight attendant is none other than.......Heather Chapin
Looking forward to hearing your reflections on a weekend well spent
Thanks for blowing us off yet again
OK well that's about it boys
I hate Syracuse
I may organize something so I'll let you know
Hey Mat- hope you enjoyed your time off
I have never had an insurance claim
Please feel free to contact me with any further questions
Thank you for your request for auto insurance
Yes it appears that the link you set up works properly however I have a slight change
Ya it was finalized last thursday night
If it does not exist leave blank and the IT group will create an ID using the description provided
Smith Do you have any interest in this concert
If you guys aren't ready maybe I'll go and check it out before you guys make the trip
In general I think I need two tables
When you have a chance to look this stuff over I'd be happy to discuss it further
FYI No - I don't
Do you have a ticket for Matt
I'm sorry this took so long I thought I sent it ealier but apparently not
Can you please dump them into the database
Jeanie I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron
Also do you have knowledge of specific positions we are trying to fill in ENA
I'll get her resume to you tomorrow
She doesn't have a graduate degree yet she probably has more experience than a typical analyst
Otherwise she might fit in the analyst program
Forward her resume to me and I will pass it along
This one is very similar to the one you just did
Hey I'm going to give your resume to this girl and I'll let you know when to follow up
As I indicated this information is a competitive advantage of ours so it should stay in the company
Please keep this within the company as it represents a competitive advantage to Enron
I would look at it again but I'm late for my class
Here's a copy of the spreadsheet we gave to Bill Bradford
On-Line tries to be sensitive to our client's busy schedules
Sorry I missed you guys Friday night
What do you think about the prospectsof a combined happy hour
If we can get these matched to their IHS DRN counterparts that would be great
If not we can make up the IHS number as we have in the past
It's me your favorite coworker
Thank you for booking your travel with Continental Airlines
Well thank you for the clarification
I mentioned that I talked to you and he had nothing but nice things to say about you
Tuesday is good for me as far as I could tell
I'm not visiting you
You're just a place to lay my head
I will be attending the happy hour on Thursday
I'd like to help but to be honest I don't know what LPG stands for
Let me know and I'll see what I can do
I would prefer a month long stay
It's totally my fault
Anyway I do want to catch up with you sometime
Also I will be back in NY in two weeks but only for one day
So check your calendar for the Sunday after Thanksgiving
I'm getting in early in the morning so maybe we could go out to lunch or something
I'll give you a call sometime this week
When are the best times to get a hold of you
You can pretty much get a hold of me anytime
Anyway I speak to you soon
You remember Dave don't you
What are we going to do Brief
Anyway I hope your Thanksgiving was nice although it sounds like your work responsibilities are indifferent to holidays
I give you a call soon
For your reference the error message is below
Everything went well and you
Let me know when you do and I'll do the same
I'm sure we both did fine since they didn't give us the technical tests
Did we not already do this
Anyway I'll call you later...ok
What did I say
Do you read your emails or what
I want descriptions
I want chicks
I need a chick
I need a really cool chick to hang out with
Seriously you better fucking call me
Hey you still coming to H-town
Hey I for some reason just got your email
Do you need any more info
Hey are you there...
How was your night
I was thinking about old times
Hey you know my email doesn't update automatically I actually have to refresh it manually
Hey do you have instant messenger
Anyway I have it and I think you should so you can send me an instant message
Call me whenever you want
Just think you'd be able to send me a message and I instantly read it
Tu no me escuche
Review your choices carefully
On American the one's I sent are the about the only ones
Hey I hope things are still going well
Let's just say my plate looks to be full
By the way I'm sure you saw the previous email from our buddy Ted Bland
I also saw mention of a mentoring program
Just so you know I should be home around six or so
So any more info regarding the chicks...or I mean ski trip
As lucky as I am it's probably the worst one for everyone
Hey do you think you could send me emails of all of those going
I think we should start copying the whole group on correspondance
Your analysis of the database structure and its intent is correct
Please let me know if I can still attend these sessions
Hey what's up my friend
I'm assuming that you are indeed still there
Please say hello to Pat Joanne and Juan Carlos for me
By the way it was bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did
Had he done so sooner I would have taken his spot
Is there something further that I need to do
I'll give a call sometime but I don't think I have the number anywhere
When are you thinking of coming
It sounds like your new job is cool
Give me a call today as you indicated
I e-mailed Sharon and Bill and gave Duncan the skinny
Did you find out when it might be availible then
I'll call you today for a final chat
How are you feeling today
Well if you're still there I hope the studying is going well
Neither of us wanted to do it and Ted got stuck with it
It's not Ted's fault but he really had a rough day because of it
Of course I have a whole weekend of work to look forward to
Anwyay it looks like I'm about done here so I have one last word for you...Adios
Matt I'm sorry I have'nt done any testing
I'm working this weekend so I'll give it a go
I must have missed your call the other day
Regardless I'll be available all weekend with my phone with at all times
Just kidding I can't really respond right now so I'll give you a call later
I don't think I'm going to come now so the time constraint is off
I can't believe you're not going to be there
When are you leaving/coming back
By the way I finally spoke with Jennifer today
So did you have a good time
Who did you go with
That means you must have missed Buffy and Angel
Oh I bet you taped it though and no I didn't watch them incase you were wondering
Oh and have you talked to Dave lately
Anyway I have to run
Hey are you at work today
Did you have fun last night
I want my bed too
Ideally I'm going to take a nap when I get home so I can go out later
The AGA storage injection number came out low so I think we're losing a bunch of money today
Don't you want to hear about my new project though
Well it's good to hear from you
I haven't reserved the place yet but as of yesterday it was still available
So when do you think the rest will be on the way
Once I know I'll go ahead and get the place
Give me a call though
I'll try you today if I don't hear from you first
So tired I am
I would be happy to attend lunch on Thursday
Weather was really nice so Mark and I went to a bar that's half outside to watch some football
Only thing is the one game we wanted to watch wasn't on
Then we went home and grilled some steaks
I like steak
Did you get all of your laundry done
Could you also please forward this email on to Ted
Let me know if you have any questions regarding park city
Any idea why it does that
The way I figure it you might as well drink some good beer while you're still employed
Have you scheduled a flight
I can probably drive you to the airport on my lunch
Have you taken a lunch
I already ate but I need to take a break
Maybe we could rendezvous
Hope you're feeling better today and that bitch doesn't give you any shit
Or I will try and call you at home so pick up the phone at my house
Yes you should be able to pull the loads
When I get back to Houston Friday we can set up the query for you to use
I have to= run
SO I am so pumped about Utah
I say let's get the tickets and start planning
Just thought I would let you know that we are too
So how did your weekend go with the chica
Fortunately...the day is over for me
AND i'm in a good mood because some the girl that him my car called and confessed
Anyway she called her insurance and it's all good now
How are you feeling this morning
I am sorry to keep bothering you but what exactly does that mean
I'm sure you are busy so this will be my last message
Is there no availability at the lodge or are you unavailable
But at some point before noon tomorrow I will need to know your flight info
You still didn't answer my question
I continue to write to you but you don't write back
Anyways I heard that Skamania lodge is a cool place to stay
I don't know what you think about that
If you want I can contact them
Hey I think I like to send an email to every that was at the party
Hey glad to know you are recovering swiftly from Friday nights festivities
I think I just might have finally kicked my hangover
As exhausted as I was I had to meet keith at the office Sat
Anyway I had a great time hanging out Friday night and I'm glad you did too
Hope to see you around soon
Give me a call if you're going to be around anytime
Just wanted to say thanks for hanging out I really had a good time
Take care and catch you sometime at the FP or Lil W Mo
Sorry I didn't get back to you right away
Because I had my hard drive switched out last week I have to reinstall SQL server on my computer
Please check back with me and I should be able to provide you with the load data
Thanks for checking into it
Maybe it was used at one time or another but just got forgotten
Anyway it's not a big deal to wait until we get into the new building
Let me do some checking
Let me know what my options are
I will give you a call to discuss
Also we do need an ops sheet modified
More importantly by the weekend we're going to need my Keytext Socal capture to work
I need to reinstall SQL on my machine
I can't remember where it is
Do you know what changes you are going to make yet
Ina Please book me on these flights to Portland
I mean am I going to have to bring my ski jacket
Hopefully the weather will be good when you come to visit
Are you going to take that Friday off or are you going into work
I might be able to take it off if you are
Well I am still super busy at work but am able to find the time to corresponde with you
Hey I think I lost your work number
No this woman that I work with informed me that in the beginning it was the goat
Why she needed to share this with me I don't know
I am not familiar with the goings on of fraternities
Did you have some sort of run in
Do you need to share
You know it wasn't my idea I was coerced into the closet
I think they're saving it up for this weekend
I think we're having a party on Saturday
I don't know I am rambling
Hey I got an error back because the files were too big
You never know when they're going to remove it
The report you dropped off is a good start
I'll drop it off when I'm finished
Since you set my security up for the fundamentals database I can't access any of the outage tables
I assume this is to reserve the hotel
Do you have a credit card
No one is around right now but I'm wondering if it works or if anyone ever uses it
I just got a box and I have the second line programmed in
If you get a chance why don't you see if it works on your end
I would prefer the information be emailed to me
What's up my brother
Anyway I'd like to give you a call sometime and catch up so definitely send me your number
So I just realized that next weekend is homecoming
Well since I hope to talk to you soon...that's it
Are you guys still planning on selling gas back
Hey Please send me Mat Smith's email
Actually I don't know the number yet
Sorry I haven't been available last night
I was out
I wasn't able to get ahold of you
I hope that it was and that you were able to relax a little bit
Do you know your new phone number
I would like to talk with you soon if you do
I have news to tell you
I was originally supposed to go to Boston but Loretta and I changed our minds
I think she is moving into a new place this weekend
Delivery was withheld because I specified a residential address
In response I would like to have the order delivered to the apartment offices at the delivery location
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments
I found grandmom to be very sexy
I hope this brings you much joy
I know this is a little demented but it is sort of funny
Since you don't know your address this is what I have to send you
I hope you have a good day
No I haven't done much celebrating yet
Thought I would wish my boy a happy happy birthday
Hope you had a great one
So what did you do to celebrate
I still cannot access Sitara Reports
After you last let me know it was taken care of I do seem to remember it being accessible
However it definitely is not working currently
Anyway I just wanted to say thank you for the shirts
I think they're great
I am keeping very busy here at school
I know I am ready for a vacation how about you
I am still trying to get organized- what a pain
I just wanted to say hi
I'll be talking with you soon
Come by and I'll show you where it is
Can you please look into this and get back to me
The Jaguar system did not get updated to account for that but it is updated now
Hey I checked out the test chart you did for outages
Does this charting tool allow us to customize the chart features to the extent excel does
If so Jason can tell you how we'd like them set
Let's also discuss what interactivity we can build into this page
Matt Thank you for the codes
Do you know the code for Sumas
I don't remember exactly which locations you need the index curves for but these should give you a start
Let me know which ones I've left out from your list
Actually I'm not sure whether I want Gas Daily Index's or Physical Index's...Gas Daily preferably
A list or the file you use would be great
I assume you mean physical index
Hey I installed SQL server...I feel like a real professional now
Although I don't remember exactly which table I'm looking for
If it is where do I find what the Scenario ID field means
Hi Matt I need to pull some daily gas settlement prices from the Oracle database in Houston
Do you know the codes those for those points
You have exceeded your VaR limit
Matt Here is the list of counterparties that I have excluded
For your records here are my eol sim trades for the month of september through today
I do not see this trade in my EOL transaction history
Can you please look into this
A month or so ago you requested access to sitara reports for me
You said it was completed but the icon on the sitara launch pad is still greyed out
Can you please pass this on to the appropriate person
Anytime you get a chance is fine
Just let me know what works
I know you love email correspondence so you'll be sure to write back
Since this thing with my family it really has put a lot of things into perspective
I hope you feel better
However I generally don't truly like people who I work with for whatever reason
OK I changed my mind...the answer is yes
Hi Matt I checked out the hydro data
I've pointed our scraper to the new site and the data is currently being imported into our database
I don't recall needing any additional functionality from CQG
In fact I don't even use CQG
Could you be referring to someone else
Please let me know if you can provide assistance
Oh yes it was a good contest
I only watched the first half though because I was tired and went to bed
Today I'm watching our stock go to shit once again
It's only a matter of time before we shut the doors
Maybe the government will bail us out
Did you have some football-loving fun last night
I washed your sock
Would you like me to send it to you
If so I need an address
For real I have your sock
I can keep it if you don't want it but it is too big for me
Hey your database sucks
Word...when will it be a good buy
I have no news other than that
Looks like Dynegy may buy us
Can you check on this
The location name I believe is Inventory Chang
If it's not being scaped let's get it started
Why aren't you answering your work phone
Do you have any idea when this will be completed
Can you please set up an EOL id for Matt Smith
Please forward to Matt and myself once that is ready
Apparently Stephanie is out of the office do you know if someone else can set up the EOL
They tell me they will be ready no later than tomorrow
Karen O'Day is setting it up in her absence
I spoke with her yesterday and she is working on it
This is typical of the communication we are getting
Let's assign a D to it
I heard the news
Is this something you set up
I am glad to hear that you're not freaking out
As for Kate she is pretty much ambiguous to the whole thing
She doesn't have and money invested in Enron so if she looses her job she won't be that sad
So you aren't sure what you're going to do
At least you have options
Kate said she going to find herself a mullet
After tonight your trades will hit immediately after they are executed
There was a problem with your book on Friday night
The deal is a valid sale that I executed but it does not appear to be valued correctly
I would contact Ashley directly but I don't know her last name
I can't imagine that the company will go totally bust
I know that you and Jeff have been thinking about it
I logged out and Kobra still does not work
We're watching you
I'll get it done
Do you have a problem doing this
I do have time this week but not much because it's bid week
I have not confirmed that these are the correct values but this should get you started
I believe I originally input the deal to go to Mike's book which is the correct book
Could you have meant to send it to another Mat Smith
Customer has rang as she has had no correspondence about thisquery
I'm available today to help any way I can
Matt I think I cracked the query to give a counterparty based position of the SoCal product you requested
Initially I only need the results in Excel format so the West desk can work it into their forcasts
Alternatively we can use a pivot table if the results of a list query are provided
Per our conversation the following table shows four storage inventories that we need to track/compute/report etc
Currently our reporting/storage system does not allow us to make these balances available on our reports
At a minimum we need to have temporary system in place before the end of the week
I could check them if you could print out the saved pages for me
Are you around Thursday
Where would you go rafting anyway
Anyway give me a call sometime and I'll try you when I get chance
If you have any questions feel free to contact me at the number below
They couldn't give me a time though
I better get to the range tomorrow
Anyway that's all I have
One more thing we have no way of knowing what gas was bought at index vs daily
The problem is that by making it into a read-only file some commands have become disabled
I can be emailed or I can make the arrangements to call you whatever's better for you
The line you deleted simply saves the current record
Deleting it will not cause any problems in a read-only database
I hope things are well on the island
Please pass along my regards to everyone
I do not know what this is in reqard to
Did we fix this yet
I just want to get it done
Monday doesn't work for me because I'm flying back
Jeff will be around in case you didn't know
Come to think of it that sounds great
So what does your itinerary look likle
I think you should
It would be a great since I would know when you're on the computer
Here are the meter points we are interested in
I recently requested historical flow information from Questar pipeline
I have attached my original request and Questar's response
Per our conversation yesterday I'd like to test the send key process for obtaining the Socal hourly storage postings
When you get a chance can you make the long journey across the isle to take a look
According to Patti Williams was doing maintenance to its site and did not come back up
Unfortunately I was not home at that time to be able to reset them
I have reset all of the jobs...unfortunately I suspect there is data loss for the above cycles
This site still appears to be having problems so it should be checked for the next couple of days
I put it in the Dropbox though
As I understand Lori Creer was going to check with her supervisors/management and get back with you
Since I didn't talk to her until late Monday I didn't really expect to hear from her yesterday anyway
I will follow up as soon as I get a chance
What is your RC number or would Tara be able to take care of it
Also did you send this message before you finished it
Do you still need any help
I am looking for volunteers to particpate in this event
Here's another file I need loaded ASAP
Should I give Lori a call again
She is going to try to get hold of him right now and she will call me back
Unfortunately a lot of production in Keystone moves onto intrastate pipelines that we do not have data for
We will manually enter this point until we can automate it
Anyway you should definitely take an earlier flight so we could go to dinner or something
I could leave work pretty much anytime on wednesday so just let me know
Anyway let me know what your plans are
Let me know how things are with you
I HAVE SOME POWER WHAT IS YOUR BID
I am looking into tickets right now
Please give me a call when you would like to meet

Salary ranges vary depending upon experience but I think we are pretty competitive

I'm by your house all the time
I can just stand outside
Susan Bailey is sending you something from that fancy flower store I can't think of the name now
Don't you dare throw that away I'll rescue it
Should I have them send chocolate instead
I'll see what I can do if someone else calls
Sara Whoever inherits the Deutsche Bank file from me needs to look at this latest draft
Tanya We finally got a draft of the CSA from their counsel
Is the MAC trigger for both of us below BBB-
Do you want to insist on requiring both ratings
Here is my updated status memo
I reviewed the revised drafts
I don't think we're at a point to finalize
I think the other changes in the draft are generally ok or need a little clarification e.g
Ana I just got to open this up now
What a week it has been
It's nice to have someone around with me during the day
Have you seen the shore house
Well I need to get back to the baby
You will help him as he grows And love and protect him Heaven knows
And there'll be no other like his big brother
It was NOT fun at all but I made it through
How are you adjusting
Oh I received the thank you cards and will distribute them
Thank you for the nice one to me
We are trying to find a good pediatrician in our area
Who did you use
Take care maybe we can speak later
Cindy Thought I would try e-mailing you since using the phone is more of a challenge
Before I forget what is the name of the breast pump that you are using
Looks like the one that I have is not that great
How many ounces should I expect to be able to pump
I'm trying to judge whether I should keep this pump
What type of formula do you use
Alos do you have any secret methods for putting Jillian down to sleep
Do you let her suck on a pacifier
All Charles wants to do is suck on me
Arthur was better at falling asleep on his own
He is really into tennis now which I am thrilled about
Sue How are you and Cate doing
Take care both of you and call or write me
I know that things will settle down soon
He'll be in his crib in a few weeks
As for the swap group yes they are thin but they appear to be hanging in there
I spoke with Mark yesterday
I could ask my wife for other names
I got out just in time
After a prolonged stay in the hospital we are both home now and doing really well
I feel really good and everything seems to be healing okay
Give it to Mark to approve
Sara I will call you probabbly mid-morning tomorrow
Charles' schedule is still unpredictable but I'm sure we will hook up one way or another
Sara I have not worked with Stikeman but Shari has
What should be done with it
Noel I am on maternity leave
Craig Please take me off of this list as I am on maternity leave
If any additions or deletions are required please advise me
Mark Thiat sounds right but I would have Leslie take a look at it
Does that sound right to you
Kathy I am on maternity leave and will not be able to attend this function
Suzanne Everything is fine although I am really looking forward to spending more time out of the house
I think that Bill and I need some space as well
Can you sense that I am getting restless already
Alos if people want to visit me here at the house ask them to call me
I can't believe that I actually miss work but I do
Could you please be on the look-out for it
Let me know if there is anything else
I need your opinion on how to address these differences
There is legislation pending right now as I write this e-mail
Even if the PUC were to act the legislature could override their action with a statute
I hope tis helps you in understanding the situation
On coalitions I was thinking about other market participants
I'd say we want tariff language before any investigation
I don't typicall= y like investigations
I like complaints
If we have draft tariff language I'd push pretty hard
Jim please see me about this issue
However I can call El Paso and find out how they interpret it
We can pull the settlement and see if it stipulates some sort of treatment but I would doubt it
We you able to pull together a clear definitive conclusion on how the RE-recall rights work
Please let me know what should I answer
Please make sure you are on Shirley's mailing list I didn't see your name listed
It is on his calendar
I just found out about this requirement hence the late notice to you
If there is any problem please let me know
Also I have a call in to Mayor Willie Brown but so far I haven't heard bac= k
Don't we need a member to carry the provision
Any review use distribution or disclosure by ot= hers is strictly prohibited
I am comfortable with trying to settle
I hate that this new Commission has to litigate this case
Appreciate your thoughts
Hope you and Grace are having a good day
I spoke with her today and she'd be happy to help out
Can Mary Schoen help us out on this stuff
We need to first evaluate the rulemaking against our interests then determine whether IEP can handle it for us
IEP is monitoring this matter through its Regulatory Committee
Jennifer can keep you updated
Per Jim Steffes' request I will keep you posted
Have you heard about it
Remember you may have to refresh = your browser
I am meeting w/ Laura Frank Scott and Mike this week
BTW I will be out of the office Monday-Thursday of next week
However that could change if their petition is denied
Please let me know how you'd like to proceed
If we do I'll be happy to help you with composition of the documents
Can you make this phone call
We can use them
Kevin -- Last update that I know about for CDWR costs
Please send your responses to this group by COB Wednesday
I haven't processed a bill
I don't know if we need to do anything
Seems like they are just acquiring= the MAIN facilities not market design material
Have you spoken to anyon= e at ARTO to inquire
That is great assuming I did not skim from too= high an altitude
Is it too late
Is it irrelevant to the FERC pro= cess
I am concerned about taxes for two reasons
After it has considered the = comments FERC will issue a NOPR
I will be taking the lead on drafting our comments
Please contact me if you need further information
We will forward it when it become= s available
Of course please let me know if you have any question/advice
Should we just have Sam do that work
No but I will check in with the gang
Can you also please process Jose's documents
Here are some thoughts from me
I appreciate all your input and help with putting this together
Who are they hiring as lobbyists
Merchant power companies however make their money by selling power on the wholesale market to other power suppliers
Because of bid week we can't move the data from development to production until next week
Good to hear you were ok Let us know if you need anything
It's my understanding that Janine is just reviewing the Eastern US
If I'm wrong Janine please correct me
Please advise if you prefer this format or you think that percentage change in price is more meaningful
Not for us to contact the ISOs about our Material change
You can count on my total support
Hey do you have a few minutes on Mon
This would be after the Thanksgiving holidays I believe
I'll let you know as soon as I have more info
Elizabeth and others we have already discussed the importance of Enron weighing in separately in this proceeding
Do you want to choose the time and place
I'll discuss with Amr to ensure his agreement
This is the order I am following
I am currently working on it
I did not begin to gather information yet
I am gathering information
Begun to fill it and stopped
My thanks to Aaron Thomas for his assistance on this section
If you have any comments please respond by the end of the week
Thanks for our new model
Pls let me know how it is going
I appreciate your note greatly
While we didn't always win we did always give the other side the fight of their lives
Best of luck in your future plans
I'm sure that we will talk again and often
I will look back on my time here with fond memories especially our battles in Pennsylvania
Give my regards to Marianna and Gracie
I wish you all the very best
I agree that we are losing money
Even if we win we are only forcing FERC to reconsider at some later time
Otherwise we will stay in the appeal
I do think that these points are important and maybe Jean R can get them in verbally as appropriate
Yes but I think we may lose that rating
If it defaults then a deposit is required
Gloria and I understand that we did not default
Kindly advise if you have any question
Ok for you to cover the whole country
I had forgotten our discussions
If you would prefer that I stick to the east and midwest that's fine just let me know
Maybe we should clairfy our concerns
Maybe I am missing something
I appreciate blanket authority but I wonder about exactly how this would be constructed
I spoke with Ashley yesterday
Will keep you in the loop
I had called him to set up a meeting
But don't delay talking with him
You had suggested that once this happens we should make contact with him
We can help them and vice versa
Stranded Costs Attached is the stranded cost analysis we did
Don't hesitate to call if you need more info
What position will they take
Should we talk with Joe Hartsoe about his position
Discos argue they need this possibility in order to increase reliability
Will you attend the meeting at FERC
I think that this is about the CalPX bankruptcy
Those of you that have not responed please respond
But there appear to be significant institutional regulatory and pricing barriers to their widespread use
In addition the new technologies are likely to present challenges of their own
There may need to be more detail in the sector definitions as right now they are somewhat loose
Thanks in advance for your comments
Have you looked at the testimony
Christi Any idea on how long it will take to complete
Call if you would like any additional information
Is there anything else you need us to do
Do you guys have a time frame in mind
I thought that the FERC didn't approve
Pls send asap the information to have me submit to Rick
I hope all of your family is well
I would if we can afford it pay this
Jim Here is his letter
Andy Congratulations you have received an A
Does their tariff allow for restatement of prices
For your convenience the revised auction results are attached
Did you see it
If you have any comments on the article we always like to hear them
Now its stock is down Wall Street is bearish and the CEO is gone
I assume you have the letter
If not please let me know - Joe sent me a copy
It's expensive but it could be very valuable from a time-saving standpoint
These are some of the more time-consuming issues I have to research for some reason
I am discussing internally
Currently we are in Pennsylvania and Ohio expanding into NJ Md and DE
Every politician and appointee wants to be on television they always say yes
Step six take the statement of support for the position we favor e.g
Apparently the electric companies are opposing him
I have not heard back from Ed Sacks or Elizabeth
By the way I disagree that we need a wholesale rate for capacity
The short answer would b= e they won't
Are there any other MD Commissioners that Ms McDonald thinks we should visit with
I told Gail that we are very aligned with their position
Let us know if you have any questions or comments
Is that comparable in my opinion no which is one of the reasons why I inserted the word comparable
I can see where that may be nit-picking but that was my reason for adding it
As far as my comment about Governance
But these judgements are based on my understanding of the WestConnect
Jim Dave and Steve - Thank you very much for the feedback and edits to the Well-Designed RTO paper
Each of you had significant issues with this section
Do you have alternative suggestions
Also please confirm your attendance to this meeting by responding to this e:mail
We got it and we are handling it
Sarah and I discussed this
Thus we think there is upside to continuing
This has revenue implications for them
I will provide an update later in the day
I will find out
Also regarding the usage - I do not know the answer
Are they going to send a new invoice with changed amounts
Do they know not to do anything going forward
As I said during our call last week I have not ever seen an invoice before
As I understood it I was one of a number of clients they were keeping posted
Do you know if anyone is going to this
We are providing you with this document as a courtesy
PG&E also mentioned it
I'll keep you posted on the latest developments
Let me know if you need any questions
I thought we did not want an ERO of any kind particularly one created by statute
So we have to keep that in mind
Others see it as a needless hurdle
Help as much as you need to
I am involved in the sale of the South American assets so I look forward to working with you
If anyone has any old files on this please send his way
After we get Joe our info we can regroup to determine next steps
If you hear anything else pls let me know
Just want to play with my niece while I'm in Houston
Thanks for the update - I'll keep my fingers crossed
I think that Christi's write up is great
As a matter of fact I disputed their calculations when I was there
Bill SCE's security requirements are based on their projected bill amounts= for each account that will switch
When I spoke with Kim she suggested that I direct the question to credit = hence the inquiry
It is = likely that amount has gone up but I have received no official request sin= ce then
Clement do you know what the latest security requirement is
Do you have a view on the effective date
If you are unavailable we have t= he option to issue a surety bond at some cost
This has now become very urgent since= EEMC is now close to going over their current credit limit
Hope you and your family is doing well
And so he gets
Remember the invoice I faxed to Barbara
Just to keep you in the loop on SCE negotiations
Should we work through AReM
Can we use cash as collateral for PJM
Pls print and have for my NARUC phone call
I am pretty wide open tomorrow
He would like our participation
Also he would like us to let our friends in the industry know about this upcoming meeting
I think that Enron is interested supporting your idea
Please work with Sarah N to create a reasonable response and our key arguments
Do you agree or disagree with that proposition
If so tell me how you see those interests addressed in your proposal
In our discussion of the Duke model we don't outline when the cap would be set
Pls print for my NARUC call
What should we prepare or analyze in advance
Ray and I talked
At that time it is reset
Even TFG did not raise that issue in its comments
I hope you are having fun at the Nutcracker Market
Do we agree that MISO is considered an Indiana utility
If we agree with that statement are they subject to any IURC oversight
Here is some language that I put together
MISO will not serve retail load nor will it operate the distribution systems that move power to retail customers
Therefore we do not believe that MISO is or should be accountable to the IURC
I will call Mr Shapiro on Monday with the exact room number
Did you ever reach Terrie Wheeler
We already knew it
More importantly I'd extend his thought to every competitive retail market in the US
If I can be of further help please let me know
Jim I agree we need to do it
I would say we go ahead and support this
Jim consider it done
Have you communicated that to Kevin
Also on RPS and energy source reporting I agree but this may be a part of the final package
But I don't know how this bill's provisions would work
If you have any trouble opening the file let me know
I have a conflict that I cannot get out of
I assume you are following this
Let me know how the desk sees it
If this applies to all transactions it obviously devalues and degrades capacity releases
They hit just about every other point we cover independence or lack thereof being the key
I want to go down with you
When will you have a new version to read
I will run this by him as well
JIM please call me about this
If I get some I'll send to EPSA
What's your calendar look like next week
Can you get lunch one day
For instance it stated the Midwest ISO Alliance and the Southwest Power Pool have proposed forming one market-monitoring unit
Do you still have a contact at Waste Management
I hear their financial troubles seem to be under control
Do we have any long-term capacity over the DC Tie
Do we have any construction in progress
Is there anyone else I should talk with about this information
This is slightly updated from the list we sent week before
Let me know if you still need help soliciting customer support
Frankly Jim and I were discussing the appropriate routing of information to the EES Senior Management Team
I have also had similar negative feedback from Jason Woodward and I have never met or worked with him
I have tried to respect that
I did not get a call back
If you have any other questions or comments feel free to contact me
Jim I assume this is ok let me know otherwise
I think they are closed in the afternoon
It's for a matter that is important to the Services group and they've asked me to attend
Can you check to see whether they have any vaccine left
Did yall get your shot
The e-mail I referenced in my voice mail
Please call if you have any information
If you hear anything else please let me know
I believe AEP is the owner
I cannot think of anything else but I will talk with a few others tomorrow
I would encourage you to also check with Dave Forster head of origination for the central U.S
Might be good for Bryan to update you on his group
Can I get a copy daily
Yes I do get this publication
Do we get this publication
A new world is unfolding and you're in it
Congress and the new FERC are out to change our world
Carl Tricoli is your man on that one
He said he will be getting back to you on it
And yes your visit to Pennsylvania was obviously presuasive
I you need any further information please let me know
If anyone has any issues or comments please let me know
I put it together from notes on the PG&E web site
I may ask Roger to review
Before we move forward please talk with Steve Montovano
Here is our current list
Please indicate how you want to handle
I have the relevant forms
I'll look forward to meeting you Monday
Does this work for you for Darren's replacement
I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs
On the question of retroactive ratemaking it is my understanding that you are correct
To my knowledge no such account exists here
I am not sure I understand your second paragraph
Jim I am working on the questions for Ashley Brown
I should have a draft tomorrow to be checked by Paul
I would say it is a sophisticated piece of PBR
Maybe this is already being done but if not it is a thought
Gloria we may need Marianne Carroll to sign
I received your faxes
Show them now
Maybe it will be a boy this time
I intend to produce this monthly
We had been doing it before
If you have any questions about the matters included please call
That will suffice to meet our rule obligations
Haven't they got themselves in a pickle
What will be happening that we must cover
I spoke to Steve about the issues to be covered so we should be all set
I will contact WSCC and register next week
I am making hotel reservations for you since today is the deadline
I am planning on calling in from home
If you send me your thoughts I think that we can send to EPSA before the phone call
I won't push hard here
Ray Alvarez is the member of the Board so I talked to him about coverage
He seemed to be uncertain about his availability
I fully agree to include these providers in the definition
Maybe focus FERC on clarifying its positions
I didn't understand the final bullet point comments
Please let me know when you have a chance to talk
I believe TXU will disagree
Kerry/Susan what are your thoughts
Here is the org chart that captures our discussions
Can you forward both org
All of their existing bonds are in place and in force
I'm not sure how this helps us though since the PX has no money
His view was that it should take hours or days but not weeks
However I do not see how we get an advantage from accelerating the calculation of refunds
As you know things are pretty crazy right now here at Enron
Would this be of interest to you or anyone you know
Also Rick might be able to join us
I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box
I have attached a new org chart to represent this change
Louise/Jim- are you both OK with this
If so Rick/Jim I would suggest putting him in the NE Gas Box
As with everything else right now I take no offense
It was a pleasure meeting with you
I wish you all of the best
More importantly I want to thank you for your candor and honesty
I walked away from the meeting feeling elated and confident regardless of the bleak message
You are in a tough position a position I do not envy
Maybe our paths will cross in the future
If there is anything I can do for you please do not hesitate to contact me
At least you hopefully got a chuckle out of it
However I have not sent a written request
If you recall their argument for not reinstating prior balances was that they consider these new accounts
If that is indeed their process this is inconsistent
I would think Jose could cover but worth having a brief conference call next week
Want me to set it up
Since my move it is likely that I will not be attending this workshop
I am available Monday Wed and Fri
Whatever the coming days or weeks may bring I wanted to make sure we could stay in touch
First hope you have great Thanksgiving Holiday
How can you achieve one-stop shopping
Obviously your proposal did not go that far
Are you thinking about some possible non-regulated activities
Nice to meet your brother
Yes this gets at my issues
I want to build your matrix and Rebecca's together
No where do we deal with reporting yet
Bryan per our discussion attached is my Utility Registration Matrix
Jim Bryan thinks this matrix fully captures his understanding of your instructions
There is no filing deadline for these comments but we would like to submit them on Monday if possible
LUIZ -- Attached is a version that I changed
Please add to whatever you are doing
Kerry -- I think this looks fine
Please reply to the sender that you have received the message in error then delete it
We will of course have to make adjustments after we have actually seen the filing
We look forward to receiving your input
Alan you may want to coordinate
We should recruit them for our RTO legislative coalition
Can you please approve
I mostly feel sorry for your IR guy
I hope you had a great Thanskgiving
Is that our old colleague Lyndon
This is an exchange I had with Jim this morning
Thanks for all your help and sorry this is so detailed
I too enjoy listening to hillbilly tunes but only on AM radio
When I am not listening to Rush
Grab me and we can discuss
How can we trackdown/schedule out all of our deposits
Did you hear anything on WM
I assume that you were already thinking this
As soon as we come up for air I'll call and fill you in on the developments
I'll look forward to our Monday meeting
Here is my updated information
Please let me know if you need additional input
Meant to include you all also if you haven't updated this lately
Attached is my update
With everything else going on it has been hard to develop the monthly report for ENA management
So...I need to apply to their business school separately
When you're finished I will give you a special envelope that you have to sign and seal
I forwarded your email on
Please keep me in the loop on developing opportunities
Shall work on it and advise on Monday morning
I think we will be getting a number of these
Critical that our message is consistent and clear
Can you fix it
Going forward should all enviro be sent to you
Thanks for informing me we will handle it
Evan Hughes are we Dual Billing our current ConEd customers
Scott Gahn what are the issues if we do switch
Are these the letters you were looking for from me
I've enjoyed working with you and more importantly getting to know you
If you ever need any thing please don't hesitate to call me
Thank you for being my teachers and friends
I especially appreciate your hard work over these last few weeks
God richly bless you and your family in all your endeavors
Thanks for your offer to provide a reference
I will put you on my list
Please validate and add thos other ISO UDC LDC requirements that you are aware of
I have lost touch with Randy Schriver
Do you have a phone # or email address
I have not been able to find the provisions yet that would cause rescission of MSG
I will have to continue that in the morning
If so don't we want to deDASR them
Bob G is implementing what I tell him to DeDASR
If anyone else would like to be included on this call please let me know
Lets discuss what we are doing state by state
I'm connected again so please include me in correspondences etc
In case you still wanted to read this publication
Just in case you haven't heard
But I want her to understand the issues involved
Your message was forwarded to me regarding Dan Allegretti and NPCC
If you want to discuss this please call me today
Robert where can I find you to discuss some issues
I'm glad you made it back in one piece
I'm sure your wife= was frantic
My guess - she chickened out
Please help us prepare a correct response
I am a little confused
Jim as far as we know PG&E is doing this on residential accounts only
These accounts were NOT reDASRed so they are no longer Enron customers
In the meantime I feel we need to submit a formal request
I would recommend the following amounts
Can we talk tomorrow to finalize
Pls give me a good time
Thought maybe you'd want to go and flash yourself around
I don't know Aldie Warnock
Might as well try my hand making $
I know John Orr and John Meyer
Let me think on it
Do you know Aldie Warnock
He is kind of like our political whip over here
I share this in complete confidence with you
John reports to John Meyer if you know him
He is looking for someone but you would be way over qualified
Who should I go to to resolve this
If the customer does not pay their bill they will then be placed on POLR service
Are you in Monday
I don't know of any EES collateral at PJM
I don't have any knowledge of EES or EEMC posting collateral
NYISO I will need to look into this
Phil is also a credit contact so he should be able to answer any questions
Thank you Ed
I will get the bond information to you tommorrow
I will come into the office on Friday morning
Send me Lyndon's phone number and I'll give him a shout
Once again Enron shows that it has the best damn reg affairs team in the world - maybe universe
Separately I don't think Enron is going to file comments
I will read EPSA's protest and provide comments if necessary
Sue Nord approached me about working on this campaign
Christi left you off this list
Jim Do you know any person in R.W.Beck Office in Austin I wonder
When I find out I'll e-mail you
Sorry we have played phone-tag
This does not put them on 'hold' for a later switch since that is not feasible or appropriate
Please let me know if questions
I need to get back with NEPOOL today
At our request EPSA is working on a letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee on H.R
Please see her question about our views on negotiated transmission rates
What is your interpretation of this negotiated rates section
This note follows up on our discussion at the EPSA Leg
Second we agreed that some talking points are needed to include in the letter and in our lobbying
Have we compared this list to our gas market termination list
Jane - Can you please send me the list
Jim Are you all over this
I called Molly Harris she said there wasnt any one left in her dept
Customers we will start to de-DASR probably next week
This is the list we had Thursday last week
Have any buyers been interested in their load
Anything that I can do to help
Who do you think should attend
The desk has done all it can do regarding this subject
I will review the list
Jim-you got it
I have asked Mary Grisaffi to forward them to Carol St Clair for review
Can we get together this afternoon to discuss calling NEPOOL
Please let me know if you can take care of this
I have no information as discussed below
In that regard we are required to make certain disclosures regarding our analysis of the transaction
Can we pay separately by company
Are we paying
Have they communicated with you about this
They would like to talk to you
Please add so we can get to Fallon on Monday
I'll try and get some formal questions but sooner or later they will want to talk directly
I am out til wednesday
I am not going to educate them on anything else
Also have we returned our physical PJM customers yet
Who can we talk with for each market
Please call me if questions
We are trying to find you a file name
Buddy said it would be Monday till final is released
I know that John Llodra is trying to sell these positions
I left Dave Doot a message
I need to call Monday
Please follow up with Juan so we can ensure coverage
Per Jim Steffes you have seen this complaint come by your desk
However I will forward you a hard copy of what I have in hand
I need to know the other bonds that aren't cancelled
As always do not bet the house on what we have to say
And we can
And we do
I hope to have this tomorrow
Evan Diann - are we continuing to track these bills
Is Sue Mara going with you
To make sure that we are on the same page
I can't imagine that Enron will post collateral in these amounts
How do I take care of this
We are still lacking any SUPPLY contracts that need to be rejected but should have it in the morning
As a reminder I need the current support from each group for the analysis and reason for rejection
Let me or Don know if you have any questions
I wish you and your family all of the best
May you have a happy and prosperous New Year
Don't know if we need to do our own study
Do we need to conduct our own study
I appreciate everything you've done
The one you have listed here is in a de-activating status
If you need to reach me please page me
If you don't have access please let me know
See you in the New Year
Isn't this the best time of your life
I have no clue what you're asking here
I would recommend that no one pay
What are going to do would be my question
Can you get their wire instructions just in case
Also I assume those are pre-petition amounts
If so I would clarify to the group
I just got what I presume is the after-hours recording
Can you confirm back to me the above comment
Also the NYISO rules may change - what happens to our deal
Do we have rights to restructure
Also for your convenience I am attaching a clean draft
Don't wait for me
Any ideas beyond my initial attempt below
It looks like we have an open door here
Jim I am talking with Larry Cafero Minority leader of House and close personal friend of the Gov
I will likely within the right timeframe given the WTC tragedy schedule a meeting with Rowland personally
I will advise when that will be
I do agree with Dan's assessment
Did Connecticut reject our fuel cell project
I sent this report to John and Louise last week
Intend to make it monthly
I will include you on it going forward
I will be arranging a follow-up meeting in a few weeks
If this goes well we could develop other projects in Ohio
Then they transferred the amount which Enron is responsible for to the customers' first utility bill
Try to give these to you asap
I confirmed your e-mail address to him
I will call again to see how he is doing
What would it cost for outside counsel to do the hearing
I think we should be represented
Nevada is a big market so if it gets screwed up it should be with our participation
I think that this list is fine
Jim Yes I think we can through Sasha J
I made a quick call to Dynegy WIliams and Reliant to see how they were approaching the meeting
Didn't you tell EPSA to not use the Monarch
After that date we cannot guarantee either availability or rates
Like we spoke about yesterday the key play here will be to understand the retail opportunities
They are brainstorming on how to meet their numbers next year
Please respond to this e-mail for I would really like the opportunity to set the atmosphere within the office
Allow me the chance to speak with you we can first start with getting my resume to you
I will look for a response soon
When and if we have real customers that want to contract for NURF service we will make a filing
What is our pipeline position
As long as we understand the issues well maybe no reason to take commercial to the mtg
I will call FERC staff today to get more insight
We are planning to cover the meeting with Alan Dave and me
Should we also take someone from the desk
I am talking with Larry Cafero Minority leader of House and close personal friend of the Gov
Are we supporting this
Have you and Jeff Brown talked about the MG deal
I would appreciate your review and comments on these documents
Do we need to have a meeting to work through this
For the New Albany sale we used LeBoeuf Lamb as our counsel
In any event if closing is imminent it sounds as if we need to proceed very quickly
I think that on the past sales either ENA legal or the commercial group hires the outside counsel
Susan Lindberg can help coordinate it
Slight change to our advocacy versus our Monday discussions
Please call me when you get some time
Jim - I discussed this with EES Legal
Although we know about the NE RTO being created we don't know the specific rules that will be implemented
Therefore our regulatory out language would be applicable
I am taking vacation from tomorrow through next week Friday
Thank you for your patience we will wait to hear from you
Linda -- Pls put on my calendar
Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions/concerns
You should go if you want to go
Should I attend
I look forward to seeing you in October
This is also attached for your review
Also FERC on its own can order compliance and penalties
I will include it in our database
Not sure if we are even going to file but want to be ready
I would have EPMI be the party of record
Jim I've already got you signed up
Faxed it in today
Yes I just signed Jim up today
Putting him up at the Park Hyatt where Rick is staying
This makes the correctness of their data even more suspect
Does this have the information you are looking for if I update it as required
I will ask Linda Noske to set up this meeting
As of right now it is my impression that we all agree there is no delay scheduled
I will lead the process of consulting with EES legal
The Administration h= as some problems with the bill none that pertain to our issues
Basically we will not know based on our bill from ERCOT what each customer's congestion was
Who should I talk with
If I had known about it last winter I would have been able to explain it to them
Do you know anything about that or what they did/accomplished
If Reliant is interested in filing we should seriously consider using EPSA
Let me find out when interventions are due and we can perhaps discuss it next week in Houston
Are you familar with this document
P.S. I hope all went well with your surgery
I will be there in spirit only
How could I obtain a hub-to-node hedge
Do we agree to Incremental pricing vs Rolled-In
Thanks for your help under these changing circumstances
I have not seen anything
Hope you are enjoying the World's Series
When you speak of the gas desk are you talking to Scott Neal and Frank Vickers or Don Black
We should make sure that both groups recognize our message
For now our gas desk also would like to see them stay in that role
Here's my reasoning
I w= ill explain
That's the risk they agreed to
Now they ar= e claiming that they were ENTITLED to that money and more
The utilities must have thought w= e had a good case because they agreed to settle
In summary we have leverage and should use it
I agree with your arguments
I spoke with Don Black
Probably just file to do it and ask for forgiveness
I have not received the fax you talked about yesterday
If you concur I will coordinate with Commonwealth's counsel
As history has shown it is always good to check
Will we have any issues with EPMI supporting EES' entry
Will make revisions to incorporate your comments
Important for us in our physical business
I will talk with EWS
That would let us physically deliver
Just something we can hedge against
I hope that these are useful
OK Haven't heard back from Bob but we may be able to avoid the call
When employees don't show up or show up late for work it negatively impacts production
Ron was wondering what or how we wanted Gov R to handle the information
Please keep me in the loop on this
I'll send it on to Steve Roskow
We have attached the template below to use for your convenience
If you have any questions please contact your Account Manager
Craig agreed to send me an example of such a test
Please review my attached comments by COB Monday
I would like to forward them onto EPSA late Monday
I hope that I didn't come across too strongly just now
I appreciate what you are doing on this
Do we know if C&I has feared so poorly
Georgia's relatively short heating season offers limited opportunity for profit she said
She said Infinite Energy turned off her gas even though she sent a check
The small Florida-based marketer approved her account for reconnection the same day it received payment
While those problems were evolving in Georgia California had its electricity implosion
Instead of building market share they had to focus on disconnecting nonpaying customers
Give me or Karen a call
I'll support you on whatever you decide
Thanks for letting me know so I can plan accordingly
Hello Team First of all let me say job well done to the Presentation Team
I have also just recieved the resume batch
I saw this recently
Make sure that you read all the way to the end
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY The government promises to give you two cows if you vote for it
Thank you so much for such a special evening
I really enjoyed dinner and the rare occasion to catch up with all of you
I will miss working with you and I will miss your friendship
I don't think that it is one of our top issues
I'd recommend that we stay out
I concur but I wanted to get the issues out there for discussion
On the rate cases I don't think we need any change of direction
For the IP case our argument is just the legal one of whether they can discriminate
The filing has already been made so we should stay on track
Moreover it would stifle future competition
ComEd parallels IP except that it is going forward first
I have asked Gloria Ogenyi to lead this effort for us
In addition we have already begun reviewing obligations etc
Our goal is to make current all of our market obligations
If you want to talk about this please call
Will follow up and make sure they are pulling this together
In the past I believe sign offs have occurred without a complete understanding of the requirements
Also Rogers could you forward to me the status of the bond requirement referred to below- thanks
This will trigger contractual default for all our customers both financial and physical
If EES chooses the first remittance option it will avoid the deposit requirement
On the IL Bond issue there must be a disconnect between us and the ICC
The ICC believes that our Bond isn't current
Maybe we can figure this out together tomorrow
Attached is a matrix that identifies our current State Licenses
Please feel free to contact either of us with questions
In any case our records show that EES is current and compliant
I hope this answers your concerns
Oh how unbecoming and I do believe it's Baker Botts
Until we know something more it is a difficult question to answer
You cannot stay indefintely as you will be out of status
In particular Could Enron transfer my Visa to other US company
Do I have any other alternative
Will our $$ margin evaporate
Unless I hear otherwise I will proceed
When I have an answer to that I will let you know
Moreover my expectation level that the PUCO will do anything of value for the market is rather low
If it were higher on the list the same issues of imbalance risk would apply
Jim Looks like we are OK
Can we outline our key cases
Although the complaint against PG&E has not been officially assigned I would expect it to follow suit
Seems that at a minimum ARM should join if it doesn't already plan to
Did we want to get off the Creditors Comm
If you have or know of other papers or links that might be included please let us know
Also does the same obligation present itself in Illinois
NG may simply have misstated its intentions
I suggest the opposite will occur that is balkanization
I would propose that a transco.= should not care what tx
Your feeling may be right but it doe= s not surface from the paper per se
Not sure what you guys think
I will probably get back to Ashley Brown later this week
Pls send me a copy of the report
As long as our customers don't mind that we are deciding their congestion charges internally then this should work
I understand the differences
Becky if EPSA wants complete agreement then they shouldn't file
Grab me if you want to talk
I agree with ENA's position
We need to quickly decide our level of participation
That being said I will be on a plane on Thurs morning
Steve I assume you'll take care of forwarding the meeting notes and the work plan to SSG-WI
I'd say that it is a commercial matter
Shoot me your number and I will call you that morning
See you next Tuesday
Are we able to vote
Does the following statement to our membership do the job
The risk of asking for this is What if we don't get an affirmative vote
I don't expect a unanimous affirmation based upon recent events
As or if such issues arise the GC will seek your input
Speaking with Gloria we don't keep this information in Govt Affairs
Gloria and Denise will you take that on
It is my understanding that Credit Services and Regulatory will be monitoring and processing bond requirements
I was speaking yesterday with Chuck Ward
If you have any specifics please let me know or give me a call
We do indeed have litigation -- arbitration actually -- with Brazos Electric Cooperative surrounding our ownership interest in Cornhusker
Then I would be happy to discuss
I assume we are happier with this message
Also there is an on-going arbitration with Cornhusker about our ownership right
However we must be prepared to further adjust as th= e future unfolds for the company
Jim does lunch still work for you today @ Cafe Express
We will be talking with AReM and will want your input
I'll join you guys at the Supreme Court invitation window
Do you want to join us Wednesday morning for breakfast
Guess it is a good thing I didn't raffle off your seat at the Supreme Court huh
Where are we on a matrix of Utility agreements
Thanks for pulling us all together on Monday
I wanted to re-cap just a bit
We physically house all documentation relating to licensing on our floor
Gloria and I met yesterday to discuss next steps
Gloria please feel free to add anything I have overlooked
Let me know what time is most suited to your schedule
Whatever we have
We have developed a matrix and are populating it
I should have something to you soon
Can't see them going down without a fight
Please forward to anyone else who needs it
If anyone has any other questions please give me a call
Jim The same prohibition applies to EES although I did not notify anyone specifically about the prohibition
Harry is there someone we need to talk to
What are we = doing to stop this movement
Jim Jim The same prohibition applies to EES although I did not notify anyone specifically about the prohibition
What is our gas exposure in NIMO's service territory
The Enron Corp gaurantee is no longer acceptable at our current rating
Legal has confirmed NIMO's rights under its gas tariff
If there are others we should know about please let me know
I have been leading with Legal and Trading
Harry/Gloria - could you please review their requirement
I give this chance a very low probability right now but we'll see
Nothing was agreed to but I wanted to make certain you were aware of this meeting
I have not continued to monitor current tariff assumptions
However I do not believe estimates for the resolution of these issues are currently included
If you would like to discuss just call
This is a cost of our business
Jim you should call and talk to Ron Adzgery
I spoke briefly with Jim Steffes this morning
Do you know if Dan Staines has an active Employment Contract
Mike Day are we in a position now to send a letter to Edison demanding immediate payment
Want to get an idea of the timing and our position
Sounds good I will setup the meeting
I'll leave in your and Leslie's capable hands
So far I haven't had any comments from anyone else
If so should we move them up higher
I was thinking about John Meyer and Peter Cramton specifically
In case you could not open the notice in Word Perfect here it is in Word
Should I follow up on these as well
Please let me know eiter way
If you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by e-mail and delete the original message
Finally we probably will need this ability for our Control Area operators
I don't have the Barton draft handy
Can you please send me the most recent version
I didn't see that language on consumer benefits
We are also writing our own comments which we will circulate by COB today for filing tomorrow
Anyway we need to discuss whether we want to join in the Mirant Midwest study
What will be his position
Wasn't he the head of Congestion Management in ERCOT originally
What will he say
When we have finalized our list I'll send and we can discuss further
As we discussed please find a list of our project team leads on on-going wholesale matters
Will you do it today
I think he would do a good job
Jim Do you want to talk to him about it
Lets coordinate so we can get the flights right
This al= lows EES to realize the value of our call options whether we are financial= or physical
However= even there there is likely to be pressure to extend it for an additional= year or two
Thanks Jim it's just what we need
Talk with John Shelk in our DC office
In reviewing this paper several things struck me
My reason for writing is to ask you how politically influential is a paper like this
Not sure if we have any needs right now
You must have had a feel of how things are evolving in our Indian office from Amr
In short I have lost faith in people
I am pretty contended with that
How are things your end
If you haven't already I would ask him about it
I looked at it today on the plane
It's their $$
Call if you want additional information
Jim -- Is this what you want for your executive update
The Commission stated that this is a high priority for it
I received your voice mail
I will try and call later today
I still think that any obligation is a mistake
I don't know why Stoness is trying to undertake more analysis
Let me know how it is going
Pragmatically high energy costs are bad because they delay competition
He should head up our response
All they will do is reset prices
Don't disagree with your thoughts
Trust me I believe a single energy price is best for the market
Thank you for your thoughtful response
In regard to your comments on the letter I disagree with some of the assertions
First I am fairly confident that no major piece of energy legislation will be passed this year
I agree with the assessment
Without pressure I expect no federal leadership on restructuring issues
I further think that this slows the whole process down
Speaking of the DE Task Force have you and Bob Frank made a decision yet to participate
I hope you do but I need to know as soon as possible
Thank you for keeping me in the loop on your activities
First I am concerned that having Enron sign on will distract from your messages
Also I'm not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that promote competition supports our efforts
If you want to talk please let me know
I agree with Bob
I guess that we would update our Complaint if need be
Diann would you start the dialogue with your contacts and see if it gets fixed
Bob how should we handle this
Should Sue Mara Jeane or I contact SCE concerning the late fees
Not that I know
Steffes asked him to call you
I think that internally Enron is already there
I'll let you know how we next proceed
If anyone has any problems please = let me know
I hope that Lora can send a copy
How did it go in La-La Land yesterday
Peter is the one who I spoke with
He is ready to go at it
I told Bev we would be interested in participating
I would like to file these soon so please get back to me
They considered we need a higher injection right to storage
Please let me know if this plan is OK with you
Here is my testimony
I have one attachment that is being sent via fax
I haven't asked yet but the attorney is in Phoenix so there are travel expenses as well
EES obviously wants it to be retail
I read the same
And it is probably just as labor intensive
I have enclosed a redline version and a clean one
Please give me any feedback
I think it makes sense for us to support this
My understanding is that we are going to work Ark
Jim Jim While covering SE-RTO issues I learned more about the situation in Arkansas
If Arkansas repeals we could face an even more uphill battle in states like Missouri Lousianna and other states
Please let me know and we'll set something up
If you want I will forward to others unless it is already common knowledge
If anyone has any problems please let me know
Thanks but my group has an all day budget meeting
His bio is in the quals package I sent you
Can I have my ass't Marcy work with your ass't to figure something out
When we get to a point to make comments please let me know
I don't think there is any problem but let's sit down and coordinate
Please let me know what we're doing on this
Get everything you can
I will push EPSA as much as I can
I too don't see how this helps us
Before you send any letters please make sure that Steve Montovano is the in loop
Please let me know if you are OK with the slide
And e= ven if it would why is it necessary
Additionally the PJM model provides an Unforced= Capacity payment to all generators based on their historical performance
Just wanted your thoughts
I cast a vote for Option A on behalf of Enron
Sorry that I didn't get to you sooner
Thanks for your note back
It seemed to go really well and he will be going in to talk to them again on Thursday
Please let me have your comments and recommendations
We should discuss the Goulding Report when you return
Let me know about how you intend to move forward
Also what did AGA do with its Storage Figure Report
I heard that they cancelled the publication
I found the attached information on the EIA website
Would you like me to put your name on it too
Looks like we will have opportunity for change in Mass
I iwll be putting together a more comprehensive plan shortly
Call Jeff if you have more questions
Enron can turn energy usage flexibility into revenue for our customers
Interested or do you want to send anyone
If you have any questions or would like additional information please contact me directly
Jim I added a couple of bullets to incorporate your suggestions
At this time I don't think that I am interest= ed in any reports
In case it did no= t reach you I have attached a pdf version for your convenience
However we to expedite the review process we are sending the proposal out as a discussion document
Pls put in my SWEPCO folder
Any time you want to you should feel free
Did we decide not to join with anyone else
Should we be working the trade press
Please contact me if you would like further information
Terry Allen one of our consultants accompanied me
Joe referred him to the version in H.R
Harry can you please call and get on these meeting schedules
Are there any that we should attend for EES
Let me know if I should ask them
I hit enter when I should have hit down arrow
Jim my apologies
Before I do so do you have any objections
However I don't know if we will compromise any of our other positions by stirring this particular pot
Do they report directly to the board
Other members of the ESC - do you share this concern
As you may have seen PGE's first proposal was rejected
They have sought your reaction/comments
Joe Sorry I was delayed with an other hot item
Statement of Work I
It is our intent to evaluate based on initial proposals
Higher scores will be based on offeror's educational background recent work experience and certifications obtain by their staff
Upon request the Contracting Officer will make their full text available
Thanks for your attention to this necessary administrative detail
If an answer to any of the questions would be yes we need the details
Jim --do you know who at EES may have gotten this
Christie below is the message I sent to Tom
Unless you tell us to the contrary we assume that you want us to file objections to the assessments
Attached are objections that we have prepared
If necessary we will provide a cover letter for the protest payment to the PUC
Can you send out something to the business people
If the hub-and-spoke methodology is flawed is it worth leaving it in place to get maximum market entry
Sounds to me that Dynegy wants ICAP in the Midwest
If we lose without the PPO what do we have
I will check on the case
Could be an administrative filing however I will check and edvise
Once we have that study let's go to press
I think a rebuttal would be in order if others agree
Do we need to specifically rebut this
Also we have not focused much recently on the transmission pricing issues
The statement also chronicles their involvement in the Southeast mediation process
I would agree
I have been providing support whenever I have been asked e.g
We have explained our needs and the reason for them
Timing they say is everything
I also don't think we should make such a filing alone
California has significantly hurt ours and everyone elses efforts not just in retail but wholesale as well
They use their political influence to their maximum benefit
Paul As you can tell from my last message I just dumped gasoline on the fire
However we discussed what other type of study we could do and we came up with a few ideas
For example many of the southeastern states oppose RTOs because they fear losing their low cost power
We can call him then
Should I put calls in to these people as well
Where are we on getting our study jumpstarted
Are we doing dinner with Keith Tuesday
I'm booked all week but next week I can do it
Remember we own pipes and a electric LDC
I will work on the default supplier paper today
I'd like to see your drafts
I didn't know/remember you were here
They are still closed but I'll see if I can reach him
I'll try to raise him and let you know
When do you get in
However I urge you and your witness to appear live in Carson City
I didn't get the attachment
If you want my thoughts please let me know
Maybe I am reading this too literally
Sue I am forwarding this to you for your comments
Also what are we doing to get the different states to adopt these protocol= s across the board
Why bring us if they had already made the decision
The customers pay for their activities
Jim would like us to discuss next steps
Lisa -- Let me know what you decide
I have a lot of files organized by state of dockets etc
I will forward to you an outline of their comments
I will be on the EPSA call Friday afternoon
We tentatively believe that our permit can go forward w/o holdup
We wanted to let you know that Your Secretary Linda created a Hallmark.com e-card for you
I may call Keith anyway
I don't think I can do dinner on Tuesday
Leaving for airport - can we talk in am
We have some ideas to suggest and want your input
If you need any additional support pls let me know
Also pls send my best to Thane and his family
I spoke with Thane this afternoon Sarah will have surgery tonight
The surgery is exploratory in nature as well as repair of her broken leg
This has been and continues to be a very difficult time for Thane and his wife Linda
I will be in town on Thursday and available to meet
I've called Keith and he says he can also go
I'd like to do it but won't really know my schedule until tomorrow
Can I give you a buzz then
I'll talk with you guys Friday
I'll send you final
These could save us some work in the CA proceeding
Please let me know your comments as soon as possible
I trust your th= oughts
I just don't want to be left hanging
We have their resource
Call Margaret Allen in Houston she'll have their number
My view is that it should be both ENA and EES
Pat What do we say in other states where we intervene and there is no direct access
It opens our deals up for discovery
As I was preparing the petition to intervene it occurred to me that information has changed
I have attached a draft petition
Please let me have your thoughts in the next few days
Did you ever follow up with the DOE opportunity
Hey at least he got second place
Unfortunately I had accidentally left your phone number on a slip of paper at work
In any event sorry again to miss your visit
If their issue is to have a Undercollection charge against all customers that's a different policy matter
Pass along my best to Marianna
Jim First let me introduce myself
I work for Mark Courtney and manage the Enron Direct Mid Market gas group in Long Beach CA
Please advise if you have any questions regarding this matter
Need to talk this morning about our exposures
You are right but Jeff was much quicker to point out my error
Might I be distracted by everything going on around me
A highlighted copy of the ruling is attached for your information
Christi has asked me to schedule the above meeting/conference call
Christi and I were wondering
I am still chasing down some data but wanted the group editing with me
Continued deregulation is important to our long-term strategy
This is as much their fight as it is ours
If you want any other info or want to discuss further let me know
I see that you are on the panel on market monitoring
If we can get together please let me know a good time
Also the attached paper from EPSA on Market Monitoring is something we support through our trade association
Either Jim or I should probably be on the call
Pennsylvaina is not part of my region
Use as you see fit
A working draft for your comments
Let me cogitate on this
We would have no one on our side
As for improvement in the market are you referring to the retail market
Originally I purposely excluded acknowledging the need for a forum to develop non-physical/pure financial standards
I will bolster this point in the write-up
From the financial community I sent him the name of Leonard Hyman
Sarah Thanks I have staff calling Snezak
Will wait to hear from you on financial folks
It was good to meet you yesterday
I will let you know what we find out
I can call him as well
Dave what does your schedule look like
A good point for internal discussion is To what extent we want to oppose to those changes
Christi - What do you think
Please keep me posted as we hear from clients
Ray please call me whe= n you get in
I will kee= p you posted of new developments
I'd let them go forward and we'll do our own
I have not contacted Reliant
At a meeting Thursday to finalize the waiver for NERC approval their arguments ran into a stumbling block
I should sign the letter
Let's be consistent with our own business
When are you going to send the letter
Do we need to replace Tom on the Reg Project list
What did we do on this
Do we have any interest in addressing this within Government Affairs
Please let me know if you would address the request or if we should proceed with local Florida counsel
I will let you know what develops soon
Also I understand that Rob Wilson is Manager of Regional Governmental Affairs in Tallahassee
I will be out of pocket until next Monday but could possibly call in if the timing was right
As is always the case it is the committee Q and A where the practitioner is most helpful
I'd love to sit down with you to discuss this product
Any luck on my password
When you have the list of customers we should contact please let me know
I should try and get back with Ashley today
Did you get the chance to look at the combined company
Where do we stand on the SCE stipulation
Can we meet today
After it has considered the comments FERC will issue a NOPR
We will forward it when it becomes available
I will let Ashley Brown know
Do you have phone numbers for these guys
As soon as I hear more I'll give everyone the info
I want you on the call
If you want to sit down with them let me know
Will let you know when the decision is made
Here is our list of recommended people
Congratulations and tell Marianna I hope she feels better soon
Steve you may want to be on this call
Leslie--when do you start
We had a good case then and they blew us off
If we see a worthy cause let's go for it
Leslie - where do we start
I tried to call this morning - no answer
Pls give me a call today
Sorry -- I need to be in Houston both days
I am in need of interviewers last minute cancellations
If you are available please let me know
Just trying to keep my head down
Thanks for copying me on this e mail
HOw are you
Are you able to jump on this call
Even if we only serve non-PTB customers
Who is tracking this internally assuming we have to file it
Who can we meet with to discuss
I also hate Arizona--regulation
I hate Arizona
I just sent you a message that changes things a little about the state anyway
We can out a memo together however Pat Keene is doing Nevada I know
I can summarize AZ and NM
Gloria can you make sure that Rebecca Fite knows this
Please let me know if you have additional questions or concerns
Also I think that any thoughts you have on the implications for EES are important
I have seen those statements in the context of California
I contract which is physical has a penalty provision for non-deliverability
I'll loop her in to find out all the details
Ree who can we meet with to discuss--do you mean at PGE or at ENA
But I need to know what we're doing with PGE
Let me know if you want to participate in the call
Please let me know if any obstacles develop
I have made notes in red on items of interest etc
Are we still friends
I hate it when I sound petulant
I have spoken to Mark he will send a list of issues to Nancy prior to the hearing
Bill B from Ercot will be present however he was not the most stellar witness
Agree that they are unnecessary but pls be careful
I am writing the comments and welcome all help and input
By the way did you have further thoughts about a call to develop a comprehensive Nevada strategy
Hope you and Gracie are having a good day
I miss you guys
Also how do I find out how much vacation I have
Now we're getting attacked for their mistakes
But the resolution requires that they post collateral
Now they won't even talk with us
For example according to Steve we won't touch a blend and extend because of credit problems
This said he was uncomfortable saying that the entire issue was collateral
Jim Should I start monitoring the energy events in Canada as well as California
Anyway I just sent this note out to the RTO team
I will arrange a meeting for us to follow-up
I will inquire along the lines you suggest
I received a message that he can but haven't told him either way
I remember everything you have taught me
Pls put on my calendar
Before doing so however Grid would welcome the opportuity to discuss its filing with you
Do want to shepherd the development of our comments
I already have it on my calendar
Friday breakfast works for me
Jim It's been a while since we visited
I'll let her know if she asks
Susan and I are on the case
This is far better than I had hoped for but as you can see it ain't over yet
I may need a small RCR for it
On the surface I consider this at least a partial win
But she allows that most of those are minimal tree-trimming expenses
Are we winning
Any movement on our issues
I'll be at my desk
Joe -- Let us know
I think you should attend
I will circulate these drafts as soon as they are available
Best to come from you
I hope to drive that to conclusion
Jim I am in complete accord with your assessments and recommendations
We may not get a voting seat after Dick leaves but we should try and cover
Let me know if this transition plan works
Not sure if we can do anything
To what extent can/should we support their efforts if at all
Does it make sense to explore this further
I am now coming to DC for the National Grid meeting
If not we may need to have someone there
Hope you're able to make it
I can if you like
No one on my team is really qualified
As discussed once you have reviewed it please forward it on
Provide more details as they go through
It makes sense because it keeps DA customers paying for the services they use i.e
Not sure if this is something you follow
Do these calls help you at all
Below are the flight reservations I am doing in advance for Christmas to prevent last minute problems
I am arranging to flight coach
Maybe Ursula Brenner can help you pull a response together
Lisa is faxing you a copy
Can you or your assistnt send me that data
Can you please get a hard copy for me
If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services we should all benefit
You both probably already know this but just to reiterate from my notes
Jim we talked about the first one but not the next two
As you can see from the e-mail we are going to have to work through our business people
Please let me know what else I need to do
FYI on the information your requested
I was unable to reach Lisa Melencamp today
He is going to update me in the morning
I will be in tomorrow ASAP and if my sources cooperate should have a report by early afternoon
Not sure if you are going
Just to recap what we discussed to make sure I understand
I told her we had gotten the LeBoeuf law firm and Brown Williams involved to help
I can't - in a UNITED WAY event
Please advise if you will be able to participate
Harry you and I may want to let people in the field know these changes
When you get back please let me know where this stands
No big deal but I want to understand what is going on with the load curtailment efforts
Please keep him included on the e-mails
Not quite sure that I am getting the picture
Let me lay it out more directly
Have they ever done this before
He concurred with my analysis
Brian Wesbury gives us the economic news
Was very aligned with our perspective
If you don't have any problems please come by and sign
Please make sure that you submitted an RCR
I agree with Christi's point
Any preference for how we proceed on developing an Enron position
Any help you can provide would be appreciated
I thought we were ready to go
Finally are you giving the presentation
I am taking that entire week off
Please get back with me at your earliest convenience
Did they get clean and safe energy
Not unless you believe that coal and uranium are renewable resources
In fact they are more than a full cent less per kWh
Yes they could save even more by buying even lower cost dirty power products
With their choices they can make Pittsburgh known far and wide as the first green-powered city
Do you know who the appropriate accounting person for this info
Please forward your responses to Thane Twiggs and myself
Also please feel free to contact either of us if you have any questions
Publicly I am unsure thats what prompted my question about allegiance to the Independent Board members
If we push for the EISB there is a good chance the Independents will become obsolete
To date they have not taken further action
Conversely the PX credit would be reduced to reflect the fact that they were to high in the past
Please email or call me if you need additional information
Also should we just have PGE pull the application and re-file with different terms
Also Becky you should let Amr know and keep track - he can try and quantify
Becky I put a call into Jay and will help them to work with FERC to modify their application
I agree that it wouldn't fly anyway
I just wonder how they filed it in the first place
I wouldn't know how to go about quantifying it but I guess it could be done
Linda -- Please put on my calendar
I will RSVP for you and me if you're still interested in attending
Please let me know if this has changed
I think that you and I should attend
I'll attend if you think it's important
By the way aren't you in EBS
Please put on my calendar if possible
As you can see the RD dismisses aggressive migration measures until wholesale markets are functioning better
Please put on my calendar if possible and RSVP if necessary
These are some numbers that I have been working on
Hopefully they will be helpful to you
Also keep trying to locate the creditors list - we want people that bought and sold electricity
If you have any ideas on other contacts I can check I will call them ASAP
If you have some new ideas I can work on this throughout the weekend
Numbers will most likely be brought up in the opening so we should know in a few days
I was unable to reach Lisa Melencamp
Has your initial question been answered
Did we get the right people to sign-up to speak
Someone had suggested Kirk Nuener I think he needs some convincing
Not sure if you knew this
He used only one visual and it was pretty effective very simple/one page
We nee= d to blend our NERC and FERC advocacy
In general we agree with Enron's position with the following exceptions
As soon as I have any more I'll let you know
Sarah Novosel and I are intending to come to the meeting
I just read the text and agree with Harry
I will hopefully be finishing this week
Talk with Rick but I think this project is complete
I think that is adequate coverage for marketers
I would be more cautious than Dave

I am trying to firm up my calendar
Also if you can't participate I'd appreciate your recommending someone in your stead
Thought you may be interested
Please take some time to consider the Council look over our website and let me know what you think

Also sorry I wasn't very nice on Friday - another very bad day
Please give my thanks to your employees with whom I worked
I also thank Gus Earleen and the other support staff
If you need anything from Rice please do not hesitate to contact me
I hope that we continue to keep in touch
Then we need to look a ways to assess the attainment of each of these objectives
In order to do what I have suggested I think that you will have to devote more resources
Finally I am amenable to discussing a role for me in the process
Is it someone on your team or someone from CEC
Sorry that I am just getting back to this
Billing data is being filled and its almost complete
Jim this might mean that we could be ready for prime time
If you have any questions please give myself or Misty a call

If so I will handle it

You are right we do need a formal plan Thane has started an initial draft
I would like to discuss this with you on Friday am
Many details remain to be worked out but we will keep you advised
In the meantime could you please provide a contact on your side with whom we could discuss technical issues
Never fear however I can be reached by pager and will be logged in most of the day
Mark could you make sure our distinguished colleagues from Govt

More to follow when I return

What would you recommend as a total tax

Please work up some letters from me to the people in the file ECAR MAIN MAPP for my review
On Wednesday I will terminate all phone service associated with the Enron Bismarck office

I have a meeting all afternoon on California
Tell Mike I apologize greatly
Both of you should feel free
Do we provide data based on contract date
I will call you this morning
Left you off
Let me make sure I understand this
I would say no downside to supporting implementation of Settlement proceed= ings
With = no settlement any decision they issue that disadvantages one segment is su= re to be litigated
Maybe another good avenue for ElectriCities to help its members
It's the single-largest part of our budget
Wouldn't this just lower the prices to his customers
Also this is why we need to be constantly pushing the political message in the states
We have a relationship with him
Why not work our magic
Seriously we will try to neutralize
Please also note that I am taking off late in September
Well it looks like I have already hit a road block in scheduling this meeting
Below are some other dates please review them and let me know which one's will work with your schedules
Please look these dates over and respond to me ASAP
Pls update my calendar
Also Susan you should attend if possible
Additionally I have invited Mike Roan to present a Midwest RTO update
I think it's great
Should I just send everything to you via interoffice
Or do you want to talk about it in detail
Accordingly please propose only those additional revisions that you feel are critical at this time
The PowerPoint presentation is one that he made to TRRC staff
Said he would like to get together but he's out Thursday Friday Monday and Tuesday
Please modify with your thoughts and resend
We look forward to seeing you at this important event
If you could reply to this message with that info I'd appreciate it
It's not on my calendar
I just didn' t know the case
Jim Overall I do not see any significant problems/omissions in the draft Task Force recommendations
However if desired I could certainly draft formal more extensive comments
Does this answer your question
I looked over dockets etc
I have read over a number of dockets but haven't found mention of this
I greatly appreciate your assistance
This is what I have accumulated to date
If anything is left unclear please let me know before we send it to Steve
I have a call into Jean Ryall to discuss
Since this matter involves communications directly with Commissioner Wood should we involve someone from the DC office
As you know things are moving quite fast
Just as an update and to avoid any surprises I thought I would provide Bob with an update
Jim I would be happy to
Should I work with Scott on this
Do we have alternative reliability language we can get to DOE/FERC
If not can we develop rather quickly
Rep Burr is from North Carolina so perhaps Duke had its utility hat on in working with him
I am checking into where Duke is on this issue
Not sure he can hold that position in the subcommittee
Informed him of our initial informal coalition steps
However Andy asked me to look at sec
Hopefully he is thinking of using the incentive and negotiated rate language and NOT the objectionable voluntary RTO aspects
I am contacting EPSA to get the details
I need to get more information to Andy
I explained our concerns
I raised the absence of negawatts on his issue list
Do you want to go to Las Vegas for this trip
If we need help Sarah is interested
My recollection is that we had filled the slots
Therefore we urge each of you to set aside some dedicated time to make our campus recruiting effort successful
Please e-mail me with your availability
Thank you in advance for your support and participation
In general I fully support this type of action
She didn't give me any details
How do we get to her to discuss
The four of us would deliver
Lets set up a meeting and see how it goes
Hope everything finds you well
This made me think
Should you be on this service list
Where I had to choose between two names I generally took the first one
I spoke with Sue Mara and Tracy Fairchild re Scott Schmidt
I may move my vacation to that week
As I'm sure you can tell I'm still having some scheduling problems
Can you confirm with the desk
Reverse its decision on the scope and configuration of an RTO.
Reverse its determination that the entire northeast is a natural market.
Dumping these efforts will retard RTO development instead of accelerate it the NYISO argues
Page me if you need to
I have not received it yet so I plan to bug her on Monday
If I don't get a response by noon today I plan on calling Calvin
I agree with Sarah
Your proposed format sounds good to me
Jim Let me look into this further
I know he thinks it is a roadblock but not necessarily an insurmountable one
The divesting company does not get the shares its shareholders receive= them as a direct distribution
Do you know when Enron started discussions with these customers
Do they have a standard service
Pls let me know the outcome
I have added a couple comments to Kim's document for consideration
I have attached my comments for your review
If you have any revisions or edits please contact us
I am not attending
I found this on the CPUC web site
Let me know how this turns out
If you need a contact let me know
Therefore it seems to me that it needs to be part of the the pending California proceedings
Therefore we need to develop a strategy to make it part of both proceedings
Please let me know when we can discuss this further
Pls print and hold for my Thurs meeting
I agree with Steve
I agree that we need to file at FERC
If you have any trouble opening this document please let me know
I think this makes alot of sense
Who would cover PA and NJ at retail - you
I will work that out with Tom
I didn't however you may have a better handle
Please see me
I think that we should support the effort
Jim do you agree we should help Jeannie
Christi hi -- we spoke about a month ago
Do you see a likely scenario or timetable emerging
Please let me know if you can provide some help
Jim Is this the decision you are looking for
Why is the fight ours
Therefore I have cut and paste the document and attached it to my e-mail
We are of course seeking for FERC to modify its decision
Given the politics surrounding California energy markets it is unlikely that FERC remove in whole the reporting obligation
If you agree I can suggest it to her if you'd like
Jim I spoke with Mike Alexander PG&E last night
Their legal team met yesterday afternoon regarding our request
Janet Covington SCE said their legal and credit team are crafting a response
Per our call today let's try to meet Mr Turnure for a meal or a drink
Is this our responsive testimony
Sorry that we cannot be more flexible but you all understand the schedule that we are operating under
FERC can act quickly to abuse if it is found
I will be attending the Board Meeting
Sorry I am so late
Linda Noske will be finalizing my plans
These costs may hit our vintage contracts
Pls work into my calendar
If you are available please save the date

I plan to renew with him going forward
Please advise how you wish to proceed
Attached is the Power Point preesentation I made to TREIA
I agree with Bob that the reporting issues are important
I'll certainly give it more thought but I think that a discussion of reporting requirements would be timely
Additionally the DOE has changed some of its annual reporting requirements
No truth from what I know
I assume that this is shorthand for all non-generation related charges
Please favor us with your comments at your earliest convenience
I want to use the existing agreement to mobilise services immediately
As you know the Stakeholder Committee is an advisory body to the Independent Board of Trusteess
Are we sending anyone

Enron provided me dealt solely with the constitutional issues
I will look at the revised matrix shortly
Please review and let me know your input
Looks like we are moving forward in the SE
Also I still don't fully understand why we are happy that the SAC gets to pick the IMA
If you have any questions or would like a copy of the order please contact me
I wanted to re-confirm that you are covering
I'll follow up with you
I like the Reg Orig plays
Amr should track our success
Andy and Mark please give me your suggestions
I will schedule follow-ups as needed
Also Bob Frank and I had a very general discussion with Dynegy about our issues
Do you have any objection to sharing our views with them
It's certainly likely other parties will want to know our interests
Once I finalize my plans I'll get in touch to finalize our meeting
You're right about our thinking - probably just to get a feel for some ideas nothing formal
Are you at a hotel in DC or surroundings

Have we done my travel for NERC meeting in Vancouver
If you have not made your reservation please do so as soon as possible
I cannot guarantee availability beyond tomorrow

However we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters
I think these attachments would prove otherwise
I want one final run through
If yes please let me know by phone and I'll ask Linda Noske to set up the call
Also I owe you a call on Sue / Jeff

If that's too late we should talk to him in advance of next Wed

I hope I am not putting you on the spot
If you are not comfortable doing that I would certainly understand
In any event please drop me a line and let me know how you are doing
I hope Jason hasn't sold the boat
If we ever do get back to Houston I would love to do that again
Anyway I hope to hear from you soon
I haven't forgotten about trying to find a name
I will ask around for the right name
Hope Roger and you are doing well
Also probably don't need everyone on the EPSA call so maybe we should organize our participation
A good resource for you

I'll look into this one and get back to you
Please put this on my calendar if you haven't already
Sorry we don't have anything open right now
I'm receiving faxes from you guys everyday and would just like to be taken off the global e-mail distribution
I'd like to have her set up to use EOL stack manager product manager and transact on the website
I believe she already has a login ID for the website but I don't know about the others
If you need me to do anything else in order for this to happen let me know
Run this by everyone ASAP so we can activate these products
Sorry just read this e-mail and don't think I did the trade you are referring to
Sorry I have a meeting today then going out of town for the rest of the week
I'll have to do it next week
I definitely want to see the demo
I just wanted to brief you first
I think it would be worth it
We're still working on it for you
I'll keep you updated as I know more
No thanks but I did pick up a pre-owned Jaguar...sweet
Congrats to you too
Per Kevin we've already sent our requests
Please take me off the e-mail distribution list...I receive the charts etc
If it's not too late I don't even need a lesson at all...I'm using my discount broker live feeds
Can we meet today to discuss
Can you update
I'd like him to be able to login tomorrow a.m if possible
Don's looks good and I'm adding Maria's to it right now
It's too bad I don't have the authority to trade it...
Terri I apologize for being late on the term sheet
Vacations have been impeding my schedule
I plan to send it to you today
I give through paycheck withdrawal every month
Or you can also call the HRGIM Help Desk at ext
Then the system will send you a confirmation for your records
If you would like I can roll-over your current contributions to continue next year
Or you can access the system and make your own decision
I left a voice mail for you regarding this
Fletcher Do you have any thoughts on this
I don't necessarily agree but I will check into it from this end
As you said the EEI defines both of those
Pam I am hoping that you can help me with a confirm issue
Do you agree and an you facilitate this
I believe that Rogers might have nailed the oil situation
Fletch As you proposed Daniel and me are exploring the subject above
So you'd like to briefly talk to you about this
If convenient please let us know most convenient time
Thanks and please send him the latest edition as soon as you can
I don't know if you had time to sit with Mitch before he left but he put this together
Let's arrange a time when we can discuss at your convenience
I'm sending this to you per Jennifer's request
Did you see the WSJ from this morning
Things are great with us...hope so with you too
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future
If not I will order a copy via Amazon.com
Are you seeing any effects in the matkets
Please let me know a convenient time
Please let me know what time you can meet
We enjoyed it thoroughly
That's the best I can do
What did you decide with Mike Bridges
If he's not a good fit for you I might be able to use him here
Great for bondholders but not so hot for the company or its shareholders
If the stock goes down the shorts make money from their position
If it goes up they profit by converting the bond to stock
Trust us you don't want to know
Then we should file a claim if need be
So I'm on the lookout for a roofer who will do that for us
If you think we should use Joel I'll call him
But I feel like he might not provide us with an unbiased opinion if you know what I mean
I'll book it upstairs here and provide you with the room#
Thank you for setting it up
Thanks for your help on that
Sorry I haven't been able to contact you by phone but will try today
Either way I'll get back to you soon
I talked with him on Fri and mentioned you might want to talk with him as well
I don't love him but could use him if the best fit is East Power
I'll call you an hour before I'm available in the morning
Fletch I can meet anytime and am very interested
Thanks again and good luck to us all
Sorry it's taken so long but finally made contact with a guy at Williams regarding your interest
Fletch I really appreciate whatever help you can give me in the job search
TJ I don't know what my ID and password are for this thing
Could you help
I think your girl's on dope
I just forwarded the voice mail to your extension
I guess you could print out the terms from the website
Let me know if you need me to research further
I need a hard copy this morning
Did Tana call you
I need to get a hard copy
Not sure if it has the actual contract
I think we have a sitter for Saturday night
I jumped up for the one with a mini CD
We'll see how she likes it
Below is a list of applications used by your groups
Yes I do use it but I'd be glad to talk to someone from Kobra
Have you talked to anyone
Are you in the office
Can you suggest someone they can contact
Do you have that schedule
Is it alright if we meet after the fundamentals meeting
Also you should receive a call from the head of support to help you get the VPN software
Let me know if you do not hear from her
I would like to contribute
Please remember that whatever you contribute the company will match
I talked to Jon and he is under contract
I'll talk to Kevin about it and get back to you
What is my current balance
Alternatively could you email me an explanation
I don't think there are any receipts outstanding. Could you please tell me which ones you're missing
If my assumptions are wrong then let me know
Please call me if you need furhter information
At this time all we would like to know is that we would consider and price such a structure
If yes then we would like to give them an indicative no
Please find the data as per our conversation yesterday
I guess it must be somebody else with the same name
Sorry to disappoint you
I really appreicated the way you worked with us
You always did your best to get an answer quickly
Thanks a lot for your good work
When should we expect them
However I think the overall status is pretty accurate
Do you like any of these for a last name
Things move fast over here the race season is going OK and I've managed not to kill myself yet
Can you believe people actually line up to get my autograph
Are you the person I should be going to on this
If so do you want me to make the travel arrangements
I should be here -- Muni Man
Let me know what our commercial position is
Will be pleased to represent your organization in this effort
Please let me know what time works for you on Monday
Look forward to working on your behalf
Mike and Helen Thanks very much for attending my mother's service
Please feel free to share it with whomever you wish
This has been a growth experience for me
True Love My mother and I had a volatile relationship during part of my life
Like many people I was very self-centered during my late teens and most of my twenties
Ultimately my mother was right
Grief Of course I have learned a lot about grief
In the last few days of her life there were many tears
Almost all were mine
The vacant spot in your heart and life cannot be measured
However not all of the changes will be towards the abyss of permanent melancholy that you assume will occur
Friends and family will step up to the plate for you
I wanted to be physically attractive well rounded and intelligent and economically prosperous
Despite this he did everything a person with two arms could do and sometimes even better
My friends looked at him as an incredible inspiration
I did not pay as much attention to my mother's attributes
The unfortunates the lonely the downtrodden never went unnoticed by my mother
People visited her constantly
People called about her constantly
People did things for her constantly
People prayed for her and loved her constantly
For that I will always be grateful
This is probably the most important lesson my mother taught me
However until you have participated in it yourself particularly with a loved one you have not really lived
Going through this I realize that nothing is more important in your life than your family
But you will always remember and treasure the time with your mother
Friendships/Neighbors As I stated my mother was excellent at cultivating these relationships
It is really not rocket science it just requires your time and being open
Perhaps it is because we all have distorted priorities
In addition she had a very tight bond with her neighbors
They would drive her places fix her plumbing and mow her lawn all for free
They would bring food come visit and share their lives with her
Well I have come to understand many things
However they are so miserable at the end that having them leave is more acceptable
My mother had a tremendous faith and I know she is in a better place
Many friends and family come out to support you which allow a chance to reunite past relationships with others
That would make my mother proud and happy
I know my mother more now than I ever did
I am the product of two schoolteachers
Much of what we are comes from those that raised us
I did not understand that before
Could you please help me get this straightened out
I can easily show us the error
Why = break your back and the bank for clean floors
Let me know if this is OK You pick the time & place
Let me know if this is what you wanted
Please let me know why the ch took place
And as always feel free to contact me with questions
I am still confirming trades for Bloomberg
Is this a good deal with them
I sure will - and you're about right
So we left it under the impression that Bloomberg was actually in the wrong
I'm just trying to clarify so I can let the traders know what to expect
I wanted to check with you on this
However these deals have comments in them that say they replace other deals
In that case would you like them confirmed by Houston
I'm so sorry for not sending you an e-mail last night
Thanks for the reminder and for your work on the report
Kate were you able to test the Fwd Obligation Report
Please let me know if this answers your question
According to Les we don't need to confirm any of these deals
These have been auto-scheduled and I've told the confirms group not to confirm them
Let me know what the Nov and Dec deal numbers are when you get them
Jeff entered them incorrectly
I see Duke Energy Trading and Marketing in the deal
I am afraid it is going to slip through the cracks
DeeDee said shortly all trades will be under Pinnacle but did not give me a specific date
Can I call you with a banana
I have a question about how this deal is entered
Shouldn't it be split out and priced against the individual on peak off peak and Sunday index
In it I answered the questions I could and changed things I knew were wrong
I've changed the sheet to include your phone number
And you have a great weekend too
I'll keep on it and let you know when these deals have been changed
Hey it worked
I have no idea what happened but it looks great
Thanks for checking it out
Kate I ran the report with the exact same options and it came right up
Try it again exactly as before
I knew we could find a practical use for Kristian's shoes
Please let me know what you can do
I'll let you know what they work out
But if I remember correctly you didn't want these deals confirmed
I haven't heard anything back
I'll let you know as soon as I see him
Between you and my roommates the emanation of love germs is almost too much to handle
I just had the most hectic week of my life
He took me Nathan Michelle and Monica out to this awesome restaurant and totally paid for everyone
I was so touched especially since I think they're kind of trying to watch the funds
Then as soon as they left I went on my Outward Bound weekend which was incredible
Nathan is still good - I'm installing a toothbrush at his apartment which I think is a good sign
So what's going on in your life
Call me tonight if you get a chance
It looks like one of our schedules got cut
I'm checking with Phil Platter on this one and I'll let you know when I find out
Looks like it has been changed each hour a different mw
Please let me know the details
This was a futures contract done by Matt Motley and I entered the forward deal
I wasn't aware that futures deals don't get confirmed
Is there anything else you'd like me to add
Mark checked it out and determined he had gone through APB
Kate thanks for looking into it as always
Please join me in congratulating Dave on his new position
If not I believe we should be all set for March
Oops - it might help if I actually ATTACHED the attachment
Could you add the names in the comments section
Can you have them put in this information
Can you take a look at it and let me know
In the past I've always run the report showing term deals then entered my desk-to-desk deals from those numbers
It looks like for our purposes the most accurate way to run the report is showing only term deals
You are not wasting our time you make our time valuable
I hided the check box to avoid confusions
I was running the new version of the Obligation Report
Please contact me for further discussion
I apologize for not participating and wasting your time
I just finally heard back from the traders on this deal
Also I've autoscheduled the following deals in an attempt to feed them through to the CARP report
Please let me know if you see the changes come through Mark
Maybe we need to autoschedule this one as well
Please let me know how the CARP report looks now and call me with questions
Hopefully this wraps it up for March
I'll let you know when these deals have been corrected
Thanks for your help with entering these prices
Please let me know if anything looks different other than that on your end
I just talked to Chris about this
Just let me know what you need from us
Could you check with Chris if this is correct
I thought that we were not allowed to change EOL trades
I'm just sending the sheets that are saved in our system
He just might get a sweet deal out of it
I just wanted to give you guys a heads up
Let me know if you still see something wrong
I've changed it
Could it possibly be with another counterparty
Is this something I should have already
Please let me know whenever you get a free moment
I changed this deal by the way
Please let me know if the broker thinks he's wrong
Mike checking with his broker right now
Please let me know if I've contacted the correct people and if I've contacted the incorrect people
Things like this need to happen more often in my opinion
That's a picture of you in high school right
Anyway call me or I'll call you tonight - let's dish
Also we will need a counterparty contact
Sean has COB in his trade log
He originally had Mid-C then crossed it out
Sorry - I misread the e-mail
Checked with Jeff Richter - they should be sales and they're changed in Enpower now
I will let you know when it is set up
But seriously call me tonight if you get a chance
I'll be around so we HAVE to hang out at least once
Or I'll just stalk you
I'll change it when Risk is done with the calc
If you'd like it pared down or beefed up don't hesitate to ask
Now the question is how do we confirm the deal
Just let me know and we'll do what we can to help
Everything else is fine...talk to you next week
I think it should be Reliant Energy Services
Hey - Are you guys boycotting CAISO energy
Could you check on these two deals
I am still checking out
I will email you the results
Per Caroline I would need to talk to the actual Trader
I feel like I am picking on you today
Kate can you ask Chris to call regarding inquiry
Mike is checking with his broker right now
Chris said they are in a dispute at this point because he believes the term should be May
Do you have a preference either way
Maybe you could contact Bob Ellery and discuss this
Just let me know which name to add to the deal
If you know anything else about this let me know
I will let you know what Rhonda says tomorrow
Please call or e-mail with questions and I'm sure I'll hear from you soon
It was great to run into you too
So on lunch or a beer after work just let me know the time and place
And I need to plan ahead as well
Lunches are possible but I need to plan ahead
Thanks for all your patience
Please let me know if you turn up any more questions
Has anyone responded to you on this
When would you like the original by
I will let you know as soon as I hear back
I need to know before we can confirm these deals
Can I ask though why it looks like it should be a buy-resale
Thus our confirm letters would not match up with the master agreement because of those three pesky letters
Until then my hands are tied
I'll e-mail her right now and send her money on Wednesday
Do we ever trade with the old counterparty name anymore
Thanks for checking on that Rhonda - I'll make a mental note of it
I changed it to Natsource
You're right - I think our e-mails just crossed paths
Please let me know as soon as you get this information
Also Molly and I went to see this movie last night Requiem for a Dream
Truly a horrible horrible depiction of modern-day addictions and the messed-up way our society quells them
So needless to say I am MAKING myself go to the gym today
Kate Spoke with Prebon and they don't show this trade
Could it be with another Broker
Please let me know what you think If I can help from this end I will be glad to
PS - I will be out of the office tomorrow
I should know better by now
Bill III - You might be more interested in this e-mail than your dad
This is a Real Time deal and that desk enters deals a bit differently than I do
When they initially do a deal they enter it for a certain hour or set of hours
BLOOMBERG Are you talking about the broker fee
PREBON Bob said Matt Motley gave him this deal to do
Let me know if you still have problems with this
I guess this is o.k
Like I've said before I think it's a great idea and would be perfect for you
I know you could get your house sold no problem
Just do it
Here you go Jill - let me know what you think
If you have any questions please feel free to see Amy or Debra
Mark - I'm so sorry I haven't responded yet but yes I did get your e-mail
Thanks for catching this - it does need to be confirmed
Would you like me to change these over
Or are you doing that along with the re-confirmation
If there are no objections I will move the deals and instruct the confirm person to resend the confirms
I will also move the contract to this new name
The way he explained it our position is flat with Constellation so for settlements purposes we're okay - i.e
Let me know what your ideal solution would be
Should we get Constellation to agree to the Dow Jones index
Or should we change the deals to forward fixed price
We'll fix this today - I promise
Here you go Chris
Please ignore the last four days as they are still under construction
And let me know if you have any questions
Just let me know if there's anything else I can do
Then I can tell Kim Hundle to resend the confirms
Please let me know what the response is from them
I think she'd do that
Her parents are out of town right now so she's house/cat-sitting for them
I tried to look up the contract in Livelink but I keep getting an error message
Please ask Bob for a contact if you place it in the comment section we can add it
Can you send revisions
Just let me know when you hear back
And out of curiosity does anyone you know of trade with simply the Port of Oakland
If there ever was a business card it would be there
For some reason the time management function on eHRonline won't allow me to log in
I'm using the user ID and password you gave me so I don't know what I'm doing wrong
Please let me know if there is anything else
Please let me know what you think and we'll go from there
Yes are you kidding I LOOOOVED Robert Hicks
Did you like him
These as well as the Grays Harbor deal you sent me have been approved and re-scheduled
If it doesn't I can probably get him to draw up something more useful
He should be in the office soon and I'll let you know as soon as I find out
This is not reflected in your current April update
How did you know this
Here you go Kim
Hey Kysa - I hope you're still at your computer
Hi Kate - I emailed Amy this morning.
I was going to give her a call today would you mind c-lling me w/ her number.
Hope you are having a good day.
I have another annuity for you to approve and autoschedule
The APX called me today
So please try to remember to check the box for no confirms when you transact with the APX
Let me know if the broker still disputes this
Because of that unfortunately you can only see the true total volume of the deal in our scheduling system
I think if I knew more about your perspective I'd be able to help more efficiently
So if this sounds good to you I think we're set
If not please let me know and we can make whatever changes are necessary
They're suposed to be transmission deals they were just in with the wrong counterparty name
Yes it should have been Sierra Pacific Power Co
I've changed it in EnPower
If you need more clarification please give me a call
Do you need me to autoschedule the deals
I mistakenly put that deal in under the wrong counterparty
I will ask Fran Chang to autoschedule both deals
Let me know if I need to do anything further
Chris Foster has requested that we set up a new broker - the Automated Power Exchange in EnPower
It is the same counterparty we already have in EnPower with the same name and contact information
Please let me know if you need anymore information
Granted I'm not totally sane yet but at least I can imagine what it would be like
In the meantime you don't have to live with mom
Then there's always my future apartment
Anyway we'll talk more about it in Mexico
Don't stress - whatever you're meant to do you'll end up doing whether you like it or not
I mentioned this to you Melissa
Were they corrected
Please call Heather or me with any questions
Sorry for the winded explanation but I thought it was better to give you more than less
Can you check with the trader on this deal
I believe it should be FPL Energy Power Mktg
I think one is a utility which would be local and one is a marketer who can trade anywhere
I changed this deal to FPL
Was it Avista that time too
Just let me know when you have a moment to talk
If cars are indestructible so then are the people in them
Let me know if you have questions on these
Just let us know if it's a problem
Let me know if you need further clarification
He hadn't mentioned it but I'd love to meet with him as well
And keep me up to date on the tomato happenings will ya
If you have any questions about this schedule please let me know
If you e-mail them back to me I can enter them into the deals
I believe he's from the Pacific Northwest
Check it out...if your gigantic FINANCE brain can fit it in
Put those in your pipe
Let me know if you don't see them yet
Let me know how that sounds to you and I'll enter the deals
Or maybe it should be a buy/resale
And I am soooooo easily pleased
It's gorgeously sunny and warm here today so I might have to go for a bike ride after work
Sorry I never called last night
I kept thinking you would call me then I fell asleep
But I'll call you when I get home today kay
Also I am car-free these days and I completely forgot you wanted to meet east of the river
I know busy
I suggest the Lucky Labrador Brewing Co. on S.E
Whichever is best for you
Please let me know if you see this come through
Whatever you prefer
Just make it easy
So NYMEX called EDF Mann our futures clearing broker today to assure that payment would be made today
You're welcome for my attention to this matter
We're awaiting our counterparty match-ups which I asked Jason Fischer about yesterday
I'll let you know once we've changed the deal accordingly
Do you know what the name is supposed to be
She filled me in on a few things and I straightened out the story with our broker
I did call you back yesterday on the Avista thing but you were in a meeting
Did you ever find the deal or get an answer
Thanks for bearing with us
Thanks so much for getting back to me on this
Is this the deal you were looking for
I actually just changed that one per Mike Swerzbin
I hope these are what you're looking for
Could check into this and let me know
Can you check into this
I left him two messages but never got a call back
I wonder if he's out of the office
That's very sweet of you to thank me though
I guess Unrestricted Mid-C is just a reiteration of Mid-C
Anyway I will wait to clear this two deals
Below is the two confirms they sent me
I hope you had a great birthday party on Saturday
I wanted to make it but ended up on a terribly boring date instead
Did Chris Foster ever get back to you on this
Please let me know when completed
I hope this gets us up to speed but please call me with questions or comments
Mike's in a meeting right now but I'll check with him when he gets out
I don't see this trade anywhere in his trade log
But I don't see a Mid-C Peak choice so I entered the first as Mid-C Index
Could you let me know if it doesn't
Let me know when you get a chance and I'll take care of it with the Confirms group
If so do you have any phone numbers to contact them
Also do you know how we are going to confirm their trades
Let me know if you need more
Please list all Notes databases applications that you currently use:
Is this what you were missing
I've changed them again but I honestly have no idea why they keep going back
I also have a parking pass available
Thanks for letting me know about the change in this deal
I looked at the audit viewer and it jogged my memory a bit
So we changed it and it must have messed up the strips somehow
Anyway if it checks out with the broker that sounds good enough for me
Let me know if this makes any sense
Could you ask Diana which is correct
Please let me know if you'd like comments added to this deal and I'll do it right away
Because Sierra's buy-back was in the Real Time market we sold to their SC not Sierra itself
Let me know if I can obtain more information for you
Again thanks for all your help regarding this and all the EES items
I'll get back to you in a moment
If John Malowney is okay with the confirmation he reviewed I'm fine
Kate this deal has a new counteparty but it is not in the system yet
Let me know and I'll change them accordingly
I double-checked with Bob and he said Prebon reported these two trades as peak
Again let me know what you find out
Until then we recognize the two trades as they are
Can you double check with Bob for accuracy
I'll e-mail you in just a minute when they're done
I've changed it to Amerex
Are they single
I wouldn't recommend taking ANY of them as I'm sure they don't taste very good
Tomatoes are available in limited quantity so come and get it
Now all we have to do is cross our fingers...no just kidding
Please let me know if you have questions or if problems arise from these changes
I hope it didn't cause too much confusion
By the way all our traders are inputting their deals now
Could you check on
Mike and Matt are just finishing inputting their deals
Let me know if broker still has a discrepancy
Did you have dinner by yourself or with someone else
Bob has just finished inputting his deals
Kate Aquila noted on our confirmation that they DO NOT KNOW TRADE IN SYSTEM
But don't worry about getting upset - you have every right
His first reaction was that it sould be confirmed
If I am wrong please let me know
Just wanted to keep you posted on this deal
She's spoken with her contact there who still disputes the deal and says we were buying
If there are any further changes to be made please let me know
Otherwise thank you so much for your patience and cooperation
I revised it in the text
If you have not done so please see Kathy Axford or Anna Mehrer TODAY
Upon your arrival tell the bellhop you are an Enron guest
Please contact her before Friday to make arrangements
If you have any questions or suggestions please see your Assistant today
Let me know if Natsource still disputes this
He entered it incorrectly in his log
I'm tracking him down right now to check on the term
Thanks for the in-depth information on our man of the hour Ken Lay
God that's so nice of you to thank me
So many of my students just spread their little wings and fly away forgetting that I MADE them goddamit
Anyway I'm glad you had fun in Maui
I honestly think it's pretty much impossible not to
If you need any other information please don't hesitate to ask
I'll let you know as soon as I find out
Please let me know if there are anymore questions
I switched the MW hours on these deals
These are correct in the system now but I just wanted to alert you to my error
So if there is anything I can do to make your jobs function more smoothly let me know
As a first order of business thank you for the heads-up on the new version of Deal Entry
Just wanted to let you know in case anyone else has the same experience
I look forward to working with you and again feel free to call me anytime
Thanks - Enron designed that stationary specifically for me
What with my penchant for exploding tennis balls and all
I've changed it in the system
We're all on his case right now so he should be done in just a minute
I called around and lo and behold I found Steve's wife
Please let me know if I should contact somebody else
I was not aware that it was being faxed
Please email me if you don't receive it
Thanks so much for your help Veronica
And I promise not to scare these poor kids away
Well the origination tickets are up for grabs if you want them
The ball is now in your court
I don't know - I'm not the expert which is why I'm asking you
Please let me know if you'd like a print-out
Also if you'd like I can talk to Sue about CASA's financial needs
They had it wrong and have now fixed it
This is their deal
Let me know if you still can't find them
Anyway that's how he tried to explain it to me
Could you check and make sure this is correct
I've changed them in the system
This has been changed - I guess old habits die hard huh
I just changed it
If Prebon still has a discrepancy let me know
And no it has nothing to do with me
Can you please check with him
I cannot find this trade in the system
Let me know when and if you talk to him
So I basically need to miss four days of work
How did I turn around and suddenly find myself in December
When will I ever see my bare feet again
Other than work I haven't had time for a whole lot
By the way I heard through the grapevine that Clinton was quite a hand-full
Shoot me an e-mail when and if you get a chance
He said Prebon should not be confirming them
Please let me know if Prebon still disputes this
There's no need for it to be this difficult especially when we do it every month
Please let me know if you find out anymore
I don't know why this has been so difficult
If I hear from David I will let you know
And Bob Badeer just entered his TFS deals so you should see those in there now
I just gave him a call but no answer
I'll try back in a bit but I think we should be fine considering Mark Watts supposedly already agreed
I got a hold of Southern finally and Mark Watts is out until Monday
If this still seems to be a problem please let me know
I just spoke with Niclas who confirmed this was the information he was looking for
If you need anything else please don't hesitate to e-mail or call
Can you help looking into its origin
Let me know if Amerex still disputes
I'll get back to you with the deal number
Can you please find out whether it's the delivery pt
And anyway I love cheesy e-mails
I'm very humble about how much I have to learn so the more people teach me the better
Whatever works for you guys - just let me know
So I thought I'd ask
In the future is it you I should come to or real time
Let me know if they still don't check out
Heaven forbid I was the weak link
I'll let you know if we hear otherwise
Please see if John can give you this information
I took a message from Pat Brown at Avista this morning
I don't want you to think I'm passing the buck
Good luck and let me know if you need help
Let me know if there is still a discrepancy
I believe the Natsource broker is changing this
It has a homey Mister Rogers ring to it
I think perhaps his defaults are not set correctly
Can you check with him on this
I'll change it when the calc is done
Greg Wolfe is preparing a confirm letter himself
Let me know if that does it
Should we prepare a confirm letter
How many times will I have to remind them
If I do drink you pay for it
I can validate the deals and help work out any glitches although it sounds like everything will go smoothly
I checked both of these deals and they each show no broker fee
I figured you'd probably see Geir before I do
Please research and let me know
I think this deal is in as the wrong TransAlta
Let me know if you guys want help changing these deals
Rhonda did e-mail me about these deals last night
She said she'd reconcile it tomorrow and we'll let you know what we've done then
I'll change it in the system
If you let Porter know the correct counterparty shortname that would be great
They were two sleeves done with EES and Driscoll just entered them
Any other questions just give me a call or e-mail
I just added it
I don't know why but I checked Jeff's Deal Blotter and he had entered the broker
Thanks Kerri - that's very nice of you
E-mail or call and let me know
Please check and I will make note and send to Powerex
At any rate I hope this clears it up
And if Willamette has any other questions let me know
I've taken it out
Here's the solution I came up with
If I take the EES deals out of this table I have to adjust the total megawatts accordingly
This could end up taking awhile and I'm not sure the effect would be worth it
Again let me know if you agree because I'd like this report to be as applicable as possible
I think I made it sound more complicated than it is
I should have checked to make sure it did this correctly
Let me know when it is fixed
Val and I have finished auto-scheduling these deals
If not is there any way to get them out before the holiday
I have just a couple questions about your expense report
Let's go over it whenever you get a chance
Thanks for keeping me up to date
Out of curiosity do you know why El Paso changed the trade date in the first place
Thanks and you have a Merry Christmas ya' hear
Just to clarify - you are booked in the Mt
I'm dragging myself out of this office
I can hardly keep my eyes open but it's well-deserved
But I will think seriously about the idea
Maybe it's you who needs a schedule rearrangement
I just changed both of these deals to CAISO energy instead of Firm
Do they still have lights
Can they even make a blended margarita
I am truly sorry
If I call and you're ridiculously busy just hang up on me
Again I'll call to check in and make sure this works or explain how to use it
Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or problems of the work sort of course
I spoke with Chris and he said this deal is in the system
Would you like me to research further
Or does everything look okay from your end now
Can you check with the trader and if it should be confirmed get a contact and let me know
Can check around and see if anyone else knows about them
I intend to comply with all the policies outlined in it
I'm sorry we didn't connect while you were in Portland
I must say I'm thoroughly enjoying city life again
By the way how were the holidays for all of you gals down in Texas
I was beginning to feel worthless not to mention sunburned
The holidays for me were really nice
All my brothers were home so they kept me pretty busy
But it doesn't sound like it compares with yours
Can you check on that one
According to Bob Badeer these deals were confirmed by Christian Yoder on of our lawyers
Bob Badeer informed me that these deals have already been confirmed possibly by you
Could you let me know if this is in fact true
If it is I will go ahead and make a note in the comments section of the deals
If they don't or won't let me know and I'll have our traders talk to them
It looks like it should be confirmed
Can you check into this and let me know
But if you have any other questions please let me know
You can now resume your poolside position
Are you saying that these prices need to be switched
Please let me know and I'll fix it right up
If I find anything else out I'll let you know
Christian is writing up confirms for these and actually has a few of them done
It looks like Carla made some changes but then changed it back
Actually it looked exactly like the stage version that Nadine and I worked with today
Thank you so much for your support on this so far
Hopefully we can work something out tomorrow
I will keep you informed of our progress
If you log in as myself you can pull up the EOL JF Report that you were using originally
Could you send me a copy of the confirm letter
But BPA sent me a confirmation on the trade
Log on to survey.enron.com and make your opinions known
As you might have noticed there was no file actually attached to your last e-mail
I was saving it for this one
In the meatime just picture me as a Cindy Crawford type only thinner
When Greg and Tim come to an agreement with BPA they will most likely send you a revised confirmation
As for lunch I just returned
It was delicious thank you
Can you come up with something more original
I just got a hold of Mike who is aware of these deals but isn't positive on the prices
Amber and I actually had a successful house-hunting weekend
As far as Vietnam vacations go I don't see one in my near future
Other than that you can tell Chris I'll see what I can do
Did you and Amber go house hunting
I had a great time at the beach with the boys
I am still checking out with Prebon
Let me know if this works with Tacoma
I added APB
Re Note I left on your desk
I'll get back to you first thing tomorrow
Kate I just faxed over the Constellation confirm just in case you need to view it
According to the audit viewer you entered this deal
Can you check into these and let me know
After researching the position further I am very much interested in formally applying to work in Deal Control
Thank you for your help Amy
Sorry about our slacking
Can you get the contact name and number for me please
If not may I copy them on this in the future
This actually makes him look better
I was a little unclear about the question in your e-mail to Carla which was forwarded to me
Please give me a call or shoot me an e-mail and we'll figure this out
Let me know when it is corrected
Regarding that I would definitely be interested in gaining access to Livelink
I look forward to your visit and to working with you in the future
Let me know if Prebon still disputes
Can you check with Matt
I do not see it in system although I see the deal on EES spreadsheet that I receive daily
I'll let you know what those guys decide
We've changed them and added the last deal for Matt Motley
Please let me know if they dispute
Let me know if he communicates this to his back office
Other than the misspelling of my name
Okay I know for a fact that Natsource has been yelled at by our traders at least once today
NONE of these deals should have broker fees on them
If they still dispute let me know and I'll sick the traders on them
I entered a couple different deals and played around with them a bit and I don't see any changes
Don't you mean Little Miss Grammar
Yeah you like that
If you need another copy of the agreement let me know
As soon as possible we would like to begin executing deals against these indices
Thank you for your help and cooperation
Yes I did finish the book
It was very interesting although it did lose me for awhile in the middle
Tell all your roomies I said hi and study...or pay the price later
What the heck is your address anyway
Mike Driscoll says he had already changed the deal but must not have saved it
I think you probably have some information regarding these plans
I guess my question is - What is this plan called
Let me know if you still can't see this last one
How goes it girlfriend
Can you freakin' believe it
Let me know and I'll do the deal
Write back soon or call - I want to know how the internship is
Just wanted to let you know I haven't forgotten you
Mike's looking it over
Either way please keep us posted
I thought they were going into bankruptcy
Now they're having APB look into it
I'll let you know when they resolve the price
I am now ready to confirm this deal however it has the wrong energy type
Can you change this and let me know
Mike is having the broker pull their tapes for today but we won't get that information until tomorrow
In the meantime we're giving them the benefit of the doubt
I'll let you know if anything else changes
Does that make any sense or am I just rambling
Otherwise call me
Kate did we ever find out if this language for Price on the the Constellation confirms was o.k
Do you want to try it out
I think you're right but the trader just took off for lunch
I'll check with him and kill the duplicate deal if necessary then let you know when it's done
Please call or e-mail when you get a chance
Maybe two traders can talk it was a note from SCEM backoffice
How long have you worked here
Also why don't you have your own trader ID yet
Don't worry - I corrected them for you
Let me know if you need it changed in EnPower and I'll talk to Sean
Could you ask Mike who did the trade which is correct
Tom checked with APB and they recognize the trade
Are they not checking out correctly in the back office
Mike is still entering his deals
Let me know if you need anything else regarding these mailings
It seems that four deals were entered by EES under the wrong desk affecting our position instead of theirs
We do want it to be confirmed and the deal has been changed to reflect that in Enpower
Appropriately Bell had begun professionally as he would continue through life--as a teacher-scientist
Characteristically Bell again found a group of four willing young enthusiasts to execute his theories
Apart from his lifelong association with the cause of the deaf Bell never lingered on one project
Apparently Jeff thought this had already been changed and it hadn't - I just changed it
I might come visit you there if there's room
If you want you should stop by for a sleep over on your way to Bend
Are you not taking your calcium or something
Anyway how are you doing these days
I totally want you to come down
I'm on complete crack today if you can't tell
I have carpal tunnell too
I was livid this morning
I'm such a bitch but I need my sleep
I apologize that this wasn't more clear before
Well I have confirmed twice because it keeps going into pending status
If you would put a note in the comment section in deal entry that would be great
Could you check with Sean to verify
I put a comment in the deal instructing no revised confirms to be sent per Chris Foster
This is the original confirmation letter we sent out
Oh wow - don't tell me you're a NUGGETS fan now
Hey - do you have a freaking job there
That's the only thing I haven't heard about
You must like it or you wouldn't have applied to stay but I need DETAILS I need DIRT
Call me soon we'll dish
I applied for a job here at Outward Bound so I may be staying here for awhile
Michelle and I are doing well although her decorating style bothers me a little
Are you still coming to visit
Also can you send me Monica's phone number if you think of it
I feel settled in enough now to call her
Tell me what's up with you
And actually my home phone will change too at the end of this week
I'll send that along when I get it
Direct all requests and assignments to your respective Administrative Assistant
Thanks for your help and congratulations Kate
Call her now though
She's excited to hear from you
Here's what I threw together this afternoon
Hope you had a safe trip back home
Again it was great to meet you and Kim
Grace you should be a mid-marketer - you've got that supply and demand thing DOWN girl
If so who should I contact to get them
Thanks for all your help in this matter
But it just never clicked
Granted this is a mere item of clothing as compared with a habitat but you get the picture
Which leads me to my next point - men
Same goes for them
Listen I have to go and I've said my piece for the day
So Heather said the deals are fine as they are
I will check here and see if anyone knows the difference
If it doesn't make any difference I will change these to the other CP name
If this is not ok let me know
Let me know if you can find anything out from APB
I thought Arizona Public Service kept all transmisson
Pinnacle West is still working on moving all its operations from Arizona Public Service Co to Pinnacle
As far as I can tell either APB or Jeff Richter was checking out wrong
Now I just want to get to the bottom of it
Thanks for your concern - that's so sweet of you
I'm sure a day on the slopes will do me good
I can't believe you're leaving
I hope wherever you go next brings you joy and fulfillment but you'll definitely be missed here
I'm sorry - I totally spaced this one Friday afternoon
Would you like me to enter this info into the deals
Just wanted to get it approved by the Traders
Thank you Evelyn
I am still waiting for Prebon to claim the deal
Sean is entering the first deal as we speak
No one is there right now but he will double-check with them
Again I will let you know as soon as we confirm this
This would help me determine who the problem is with
As for why it was taken out of the GCP system I have no idea
If you know of anyone around here who would have called for that to be de-activated let me know
Otherwise our traders still know Jack Wells as the contact
But I think that's the only connection
Thank you for the reminder Rhonda
Also please remember not to pick CPs in brackets as they are inactive
Just wanted to let you know I'm not ignoring you
Sorry I didn't see these deals when I sent the first email
Kimberly Hundl had sent you a note about the contact
Kate I think these trades are suppose to be FPL Energy Power Marketing in Enpower
Currently they are in as Florida Power & Light
I received confirmations from FPL Energy Power Marketing
Could you please talk to Mallory about the counterparty name
I checked with Sean who said he's finished entering his deals
Mike is just finishing up with his
Please let me know if these don't come through shortly
Do you know if they are still entering deals
I think if I send these emails they eventually pick the correct CP
I hope you don't mind that I changed the deals myself
Thought this might be useful for you to have as well
I highlighted the deal numbers that concern your desk in red
Didn't your mother teach you that grabbing is impolite
She did teach me to answer SOMEONE'S questions but I don't even know who SOMEONES is
She also taught me to embrace my rudeness
Should have been CAISO - I changed it
Can you check and see if this is the correct index
Can you check on them for me and let me know
If you can help us out with this maybe we won't have to keep asking you for contacts
Let's see if we can update this list somehow
I think I included everything you mentioned
Let me know if you think anything needs to be added
One thing I couldn't change however was my department and supervisor
Edward Sacks in credit has indicated that it should be them
Can you see if this is the correct CP
We don't have a contract with them
If it is correct that's fine just let me know
In all the excitement of the day I completely forgot to check on this deal
Give me a call in the morning and let me know
Let me know if this needs to be changed or if it's not showing up correctly for you
Let me know if there's still a discrepancy
I've changed it to be confirmed
Chris Mallory usually does mostly daily deals so his deal blotter probably defaults to no confirm
It looks like it probably should be confirmed
Can you check into this and see what happened
I've changed the name but let me know if your records still show California Dept
Mark looked at the confirm and said it lookes A.O.K
Hey there - I'm so sorry I haven't responded until now
Molly and I already want to boot Amber out but that's okay
It really helps us out and I think it does wonders for her ego too
I don't even have one prospect at this point
I hope you can make it home for a visit soon because you are going to LOVE our house
Either way I'll definitely make it there by springtime
I'll give you a call from my sick bed 'kay
I'll let you know when they settle it
Could it be a Mark Fischer deal
I just checked with Chris again and apparently the broker pulled tapes from the wrong day
But we should know soon
I'll e-mail you right away
Can you check and see if she does want them to be confirmed and if so please add contacts
I'll let you know when we have a definite date
I'm still tracking down Bob to find out about his deal
Is there any way we can get this fixed soon
It contains most of the same deals that are found in your spreadsheet and a few that aren't
Again please let me know how I can help
Thanks so much for your help on this
Please change needs to be Frim Energy we will need to revise the Confirmation Letter
I will resume responsibility for maintaining and sending the spreadsheet tomorrow and you can expect to receive it daily
Diana is again not in today but Sean Crandall is checking on it
I'll let you know any minute
Did you find out anything about this deal
Can you look into this and let me know
I'll let you know the deal number in a minute
Can you check with Matt for the correct cp name
Let me know if it's still not in there
Turns out I was just asking the wrong person
Let me know if you need comments added in these deals
Let me know if you have any questions about these changes
Thank you for all of your patience and cooperation
However I need a contact name and isn't NCPA on the credit watch list
Sorry if I scared you for a minute there
If it was just a desk change I can take care of that very easily
Mike still has not returned my calls and is not at work today
Let me know if there are further questions
I just got out of a meeting and read your e-mails
Let me know if you need anything further on this
That's all I know right now
Are they desk to desk
Sorry to bug you but I'm assigning contract numbers
Let me know if APB gets back to you
I haven't seen a trade WITHIN a desk before but I'm sure anything is possible
I think the report should work that way even now
There might be another reason but I think someone wanted to kill the deals
Another Enron book has traded with one of ours
When the other portfolio queries their stuff they should see their side
This is all I have so far
I would appreciate your help to make it clearer
If you find a deal No like that I think it will make my job easier
I'll check up on that and let you know
I know this is petty but it makes people like Rhonda cranky
I learned that trick in our old winframe system and it has served me well
Per your request for year-to-date numbers here's an example of what I could include in the daily EOL summary
Let me know if this is helpful for you and if you'd like it included on the graph sheet
Are you all going to kill this deal
I've changed it to CAISO energy
And that's the long and short of it
So I've probably succeeded in confusing you even more but please feel free to come bug me with questions
I wasn't quite sure how you wanted to review this information
If I totally missed the mark please let me know and I'll keep looking
These guys are still busy trading so I'd like to take care of it myself if I can
I'll look over all the documents with him when he gets back and let you know Kerri
Thanks for the spreadsheet and for getting me on the mailing list
I will check again and I apologize for the delay
Real Time isn't used to marking confirms on their deals since they're usually just trading hour-ahead
Do you know of a reason why it shouldn't be confirmed
They look like they should be confimed to me
If they do not need to be confirmed please put the reason in the comments in deal entry
Otherwise please change to be confirmed and let me know
If you need me to change the term anyway I can
This caused many problems as you can see
I can also change those deals if necessary
Would you like me to go ahead and make these changes
Anyway sorry for the mix-up - I was on autopilot
Even though the system won't recognize any Sunday hours apparently it messes with Houston's reports
Ask Prebon where they got that from.
Mike asked him to re-confirm with his back office
Let me know if this resolves everything
March I think
I have been recieving quite a few calls from your employees
I hope they have been enjoying these emails
I guess some kinks are there to stay huh
I will have a great weekend thanks - I'm actually having a housewarming party at my new house
Maybe I'm not as original as I thought I was
Anyway I think you've got it straight
We still cross paths every now and then so anything that comes to me will get to her
Thanks for taking such good care of our sporting needs
I just found the deal and as I suspected it had the incorrect broker on it
Feel free to let me know if you find this data helpful harmful or not even worthy of note
Thanks for thinking of me during your consolidated e-mail spree
Your Sunday sounds incredibly more productive than mine - pity
Then we returned home for a movie marathon that did not you correctly assumed include the Philadelphia story
So rather than disappoint her expectations I gave her what she wanted only with more volume
If the neighbors didn't hear us Saturday night they can be sure somebody lives there now
I've got a call in to my friend Scott to locate Mr Down Under Wine guy
And I'll let you know when I hear from him
I've found myself to be much too flaky for that
Let me know if you need notice sooner than that
I know you won't get this until Tuesday I just thought I'd write for the purposes of consolidation
I wonder if you watched the Philadelphia story
Anyway I don't have a lot to say
Just thought maybe that would be easier for you
It's funny you should say that since I've been reading a lot about Buddhist philosophy lately
That's one occasion you cannot take lying down or bending like a reed as it were
I hope you let her have it
She was just trying to get your goat
I started to get a little sick last night
Think I might have been running a fever so I came home and went to bed early
But I don't always sleep so well
Cross your fingers that I don't get sick
Glad you give it the thumbs up
I would demand the same for myself
If you decide to come down you don't even have to tell us until Friday or Saturday
You don't even have to tell us at all
No seriously if you feel like coming it would be wonderful to see you
But I'll give you a call this evening
Are you packed for Spain yet
Is everyone there still as crazy as when I left them
Write back or give me a call
In all the confusion last week I can't remember if we figured this one out
Think I have issues
Actually starbucks guy and I had an interesting conversation about this last night
Anyway that's my deep thought for the week
He Claire Danes' boyfriend so you may have heard of him before
Anyway you have to check him out - he's awesome
So let me know how it's going out there in P-town and when are you coming to visit
Here you are ladies
As per our prior discussion these are the Dow Jones index price reports I promised to send you
Let me know how this works for you
Sounds pretty logical to me
Yes - I got all your e-mails
Yes this should be a purchase and I've changed it
Thanks for your alert
Could you check to see if this should be a purchase
Let me know if it shows up in your report
Now I KNOW there's nothing I'd rather be doing
In other news we had an amazing housewarming party
I really wish you could have been there
Very interesting guy but potentially in the closet so I'm keeping my distance
Definitely sounds like my crowd
Should I wear my dirty jeans or my clean jeans
Cara Semperger in particular relies on the index prices in order to run one of her reports
Here's what I heard back from Tim
I'll let you know as soon as it's done
Also we have two Bill Williams - I assume you mean the real time manager Bill Williams III
Let me know if I'm right and I'll be happy to add them to the mailing list
Will you copy Christer and Bill Williams with the daily purchases
I don't see a deal number...
Is it a missing deal
Could you check with Mike
I'll let you know what he finds
I wonder what's up with that
And yes it's hard to believe there are not one but TWO William Williams in our office
I came I saw I viewed...and now I will eat
Thanks in advance for your help on this
All Matt Motley's deal JUST went in so you should see those coming through
I'll let you know when I find out
It was done by Stan Cocke in Services and those guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts
He thought he marked this no confirm but must have defaulted to confirm anyway
He doesn't actually have access to ICE data right now but has requested it from staff at the exchange
Let me know when you have a moment
If you want reports like this Justin Rostant can produce whatever you wish
I must know why your roommates are so scary
Oh and since we last e-mailed Molly has gone out and landed herself a full-fledged boyfriend
Maybe I'll meet the man of my dreams
Hang in there - and call me soon
So are you going to Seattle this weekend
I am so jealous - parties dinners wine men
You and I are NOT living the same life right now
Did you ever receive this signed confirm letter
I'll let you know whatever we find out this afternoon
You're right - thanks for checking up on us
I guess Bob snuck one in there
If you guys have any suggestions about the layout of the spreadsheet please let me know
Keep me posted on the progress
Some people just don't know how to control those emotions I guess
Whatever happened with your fever
She took it a step further in true drama queen fashion
Or at least I'll have one by the time he calls
This group is responsible for keeping records of all confirmation letters whether or not they execute them
In regard to this deal could you please email me a copy of the confirmation that the trader prepares
We will need to put a copy into the our files
She should be in the office shortly and I'll have her look over the changes made to the deal
Can you check with Chris
Is it something else
I am changing this deal to that CP
I know Carla preferred to make the changes herself
Thanks - I've changed it
That way we can both keep on top of common mistakes
This is the last e-mail I received from Laura
Looks like she forgot the attachment the first time
I have attached a draft Confidentiality Agreement for your review
I was able to find a Well and Water Right Evaluation that was performed by Robinson and Noble Inc
Thank you in advance for your assistance and speedy response
Did you want this deal confirmed
If so it needs a counterparty contact name in it
I can't find any contact info
If it's not in there let me know and I'll have it added
I just spoke with Justin Rostant who reported that ICE will begin sending him data tomorrow morning
I'm so sorry gals but I feel awful and I'm going home to nurse myself to health
If you need today as well let me know and I'll send it first thing in the morning
Please let me know when it has been fixed
Sharen had already alerted me to the first deal which I changed but not the second
So Enpower is right and Mike just let his broker know to change the delivery point on the confirm
Should it be back-dated to match trade date on confirmation letter
And he said well that IS funny because I didn't either
But I think we're the only two who didn't notice it
But first she wanted to stash the quarters in her room
One of them was tall...very tall...an intimidating figure
Her first thought was These two are going to rob me
Her next thought as Don't be a bigot they look like perfectly nice gentlemen
But racial stereotypes are powerful and fear immobilized her
She hoped they didn't read her mind but Gosh they had to know what she was thinking
Avoiding eye contact she turned around stiffly and faced the elevator doors as they closed
Panic consumed her
My God she thought I'm trapped and about to be robbed
A shower of coins rained down on her
Take my money and spare me she prayed
They reached down to help her up
I didn't mean for you to hit the floor ma'am
He bit his lip
It was obvious he was having a hard time not laughing
She wanted to blurt out an apology but words failed her
At her door they bid her a good evening
I'll stop by your desk in just a bit
Use whichever works best for you and let me know if you need more
I just entered this deal for Matt Motley and my deal entry defaults to all days
Please let me know when it is changed
I'll be sending them in just one moment
Would you send that to us at your earliest convenience
So I really don't care whether or not you care
Print it out and line your birdcage
What you think I care
What is your birdcage lined with
You open it and the screen starts moving around
As soon as I confirm with him I'll change the deals and let you know
Will you be sending confirm letters on these Modesto deals or just verbally confirming them
Thanks and yes we will need copies of the letters
Do you need that
Work like you don't need the money
Send this to everyone you consider a friend
Bob's out of the office now but I'll check with him in the morning
It might be but it's just strange so I thought I'd ask
Has Chris sent you a list or do you still need one
I want to make sure we don't leave anyone out
I will be writing this procedure
By doing this you will be responsible for making sure the deal is confirmed properly
Otherwise they are responsible for the accuracy of the Confirm
Kate Kate could you ask Tom if this transaction is suppose to be Firm in Enpower
Could you ask him which is correct
Tom says this deal was firm energy but it is transmission contingent
Kate could you ask Tom if this transaction is suppose to be Firm in Enpower
Is it correct
Jeff knows he has several deals off right now
He's fixing them as we e-mail
Do you know where they are
Grant said they sent the signed confirms to Houston
Usually we trade with El Paso Merchant Energy L.P Is this name entered correctly
I don't see anything in the system that looks like this
Can you check with Mike
Could you check with Diana about this trade
Portland General is saying it is COB
Evelyn I'm so sorry I haven't found these deals yet
I'm entering them right now and I'll let you know the deal numbers in a second
I'm having Diana look into it - I'll let you know
She said that Sean Crandall was our trader
I think cash in the mail is a little too risky
I can also use that money to buy you something get you a Safeway gift certificate c.d
Hope your birthday rocks
They've been added - thanks for reminding me
If not just send the sheet to the file and I will do it
Yes - I've added it
Thanks a lot for your patience Stephanie
Then I had to re-kill it
See the attached e-mail and let me know if you have questions
Do they need to reconfirm this
He zeroed out the volume but neglected to kill the deal or at least change it to no confirm
Let me know if this is correct
I believe the answer to all of these is yes but I wanted to check before changing anything
I'm losing my mind
Did I already forward this note to you
Do you still need the confirmation information
We are researching this deal and need your help
Could you take a look at this deal
I just spoke with Kim Hundl in the Confirms group
Do you agree with PGE or would you like these deals confirmed
In the meantime Houston Confirms group would greatly appreciate us changing these deals to no confirm
Question though when we put deals into the system in Blotter they automatically confirm
Jeff Richter had entered it thinking it wasn't in the system so I'm now killing his deal
Can you please check with Mike
Are you sure this is the deal in question
This should be Amerex - Diana is changing it now
If I didn't know better I'd say that was a purely conceited statement
But of course being the buff brain-builder that I am I know it's not
I realize I'm showing my lack of culture here but curiosity always overtakes my elegant facade sooner or later

I do not think anyone else is off on Friday
It it is ok with you I will email the group
Since it is Good Friday it might be a little slower than usual
I can come in on that Friday if need be
Just wanted to check with you first
It looks like Melba sent you an example of a put
Therefore I would suggest we change it back to the original wording
On the second change I know that the wording that was removed is important to our traders
I need final approval from you
I think we are probably okay there
I have not committed to doing this yet

Mark I am in the process of obtaining a cellular phone for Cheryl Nelson
I have heard mixed information as to whether the company pays for the actual phone or just the service
At this point I am believing that the company will only pay for the service not the phone itself
I guess it looks OK to me
If you have any significant concerns about the above let me know so we can change it
Please let us know who will be assigned to prepare the documentation
What should be my next step for this
They should be able to help you
Do you take any issue with this
And if not do you know who would know the answer

Do you want me to look at this or should you
The harbor of Port Vendres lies nearby where Andromeda could pick all of them up
I was stunned
I was fascinated by his office where the books were written
He was literally immersed in the period of his work
However he and Mary adapted quickly to the yacht with no trace of seasickness
However she was very frail
Now after Patrick's death we understand some of his thinking
But that night aboard Andromeda only Mary knew the truth and understood his deep motives
I blew out the water in our centerboard trunk with compressed air over ten tons
He nearly believed I thought that we had arranged the event for his entertainment
Later Patrick sent me the original manuscript for this volume which I still keep aboard and which I treasure
Then they sailed uneventfully back to Port Vendres
He and Mary stayed in my home
They were aboard my schooner Mariette
We met at his club Brooks in London
He was a genius and his books remain a towering towering achievement
I miss him greatly
Harry - are you the right lawyer to look at this
Thanks Bill - appreciate your help
Any chance we can get together for dinner Saturday eve

We've already mentioned the letter of credit to them
Their form is significantly more burdensome for us

O'Brian died in Dublin Ireland where he had been working on a book for several weeks at Trinity College
O'Brian guarded his privacy and in his few interviews resisted questions about his personal life
During his school years he was frequently ill spending much time reading
The rest as they say is publishing history
He is survived by a son Richard from his first marriage
I have instructed the traders concerned to execute the password agreement
I would appreciate your opinion on the attached
However I have managed to get somewhere...and I attach a draft I propose to send to their lawyer
Please call me or Tana if you have any questions
Let me know if it doesn't work
If I don't see you have a very merry one and let's talk next week
The SRRS indicates there are no requests awaiting my approval
Since our reviews of the products are complete the Petrochems guys are extremely eager to have their products posted
The flyer didn't come through - do you have a copy
Don't be too hard on him just yet
Misuse can occur both in pricing the product and trading it
This is one they will just have to live with
Are they asking for more than that
How would we ever know who our counterparty really was
This strikes me as a non-starter
If they want to be without risk they can continue to use the phone
In some cases you just have to wait these guys out
I heard about Mrs Boone in the Scots News
I thought it was a nice write-up
My mom actually called to tell me about it
Did you guys get my Christmas card
I thought Celena might get a kick out of it
I thought your Mom might like the first three
Please call or e-mail if you have any questions or comments
Call me if you want to discuss further
If not I'll be glad to do it

In the mean time is it worth while to send Sullivan&Cromwell print outs of the pages

The vacation time looks good to me
Do I need to reschedule
I have put it on my calendar

I should be here
I don't see any problems
It will become more challenging as we start thinking about trading
Apparently our people are already working with Louise Kitchen
The issue I described yesterday is described below
Please let me know if you see any problem with this
Glad you liked them
I received the package from MetLife on the Long-Term Care insurance
I remain confused
Please go into the DataManager and indicate your approval
To all we are working on getting the e-mail notification repaired
Please review the attached as well as the below Long Description and offer you approval/comments
Please let me know where to go from here
For instance what tone are we aiming for
If we want to be all legal and hard-nosed I can throw in ETA section references etc
If it really is physical I'll need to get one of the power trading lawyers to look it over
In the interim please approve the Product Types and send me an e-mail when you are done
I have enlisted the assistance of Carol St Clair to handle the ETA comments and negotiations
It's only really bad when it's that cold and it rains
Please let me know how you would like to respond to customer's inquiry about modifications to the ETA.
She said she would send one to us
Please advise as to how we are to deal with this
Sorry to hear about your travel problems
I think this would be particularly helpful for our newest members Robert Quick and Mark Elliott
Yes thanks - I think Tana is going to call to get some help interpreting the numbers
Give me a call should you want to follow up
If they want to give it to someone else so be it
It just seemed safer to me to take this approach
The package you sent arrived today
I'll open it when I get home
I sent the MetLife insurance materials by regular mail today
Please give us the final A OK for these
Pls let me know the status

In fact when they finally announced it my primary feeling was one of relief
It's nice you have Key West to get away to
Tell Don I said Hi
Let me know how you are and what is happening
No doubt you will survive the mess but hope it is not taking too much out of you
My mother has been in and out of hospital and so that has kept me stressed
I sold a house in KW in late Sept so came down then for the closing
I am in KW now much enjoying being able to work here but missing Don
I haven't had any complaints from the post office
In fact we used to have a mailbox outside the gate
Secondly were you planning on having an electrician come do any work on your house
I'll be awaiting your response
I have been a bit preoccupied
You should have them tomorrow
They wouldn't let me order without the proofs
Do you still have the proofs
I hope so because they haven't come in the mail yet
I hope things have calmed down for you some at work
Please let me know Brad's pulse
Shouldn't we have the opportunity to clear the conflict
I anticipate distributi= ng these items on Thursday
No gifts thank you -- just a social hour
Do you have a problem with the recharacterization as a purchase
Will we need some new resolu= tions passed
If you did not request this email we apologize for inconvenience
Please give me a call if you have any ideas
I'll check with Elizabeth Sager and get back to you
I think we are going to need to provide this information
Could you please review customers request
Kathy thanks for your help
Not a bad place to get stranded I suppose
I hope the flights are running by then
Hope you are doing ok through all this
Please e-mail me to let me know that everything is okay
I think there is a real possibility here
How do we convince customers to participate
This seem to me to be the biggest hurdle
If we fail VMAC can default all participating/supported contracts
Yes assuming I get home before the office closes
I am feeling good as well
I will move up a few spots this week
I called the 'Stone
So if its not in there when you get home can you pick it up from the office
I'm calling it
Would they have/use Emission credits
Are you having two thanksgivings with your family
Is that the one that likes me
I have decided I am going home for Thanksgiving
I want to be there for my mom and family
I go over the b-plan everyday of my life
Mike I need you and John to go over the bplan and preso today
Remember= the view from my apartment in New York
Hope you are keeping well
Thank you for your e-mail and phone call
I guess we were both at work
Tim Bunce was in the air on his way to California
I don't know if they let them watch the TV
That really touched me that he would think of you and that the school let him call home
We were watching when the towers collapsed and found it surreal--unbelievable
The terrorists will have done even more damage if we don't
I imagine Enron has people marooned all over the world
At least you have an Enron office where you are
I should think that would be better than being stuck somewhere in Canada wondering if you should drive home
I hope they are up to it
Please let us know when you finally get home
Are you in today or this week
Then I am going to NY
He is looking at it right now
Oh by the way we had a group meeting this morning with George
Don't try Mike T get it done
Maybe we might win then
I tend to agree
Let me know your thoughts and I will pass them on to the league
Not much said about our group except he has a direct line to Walley and has spoken with Dynegy
He listened but told them no thanks
Oh by the way my job offers are pouring as well
I'm sure he does
We did not talk about it yet
He said it looked good but he got bored so he stopped reading
I told him you would be back Monday
I am not the one holding you up
I printed out both documents for him to read
John doesn't take commands from me
I just spoke with Tom Hartman of San Joaquin Power
I told him I would have to check
I'll email him again
Do you want me to go to this
I was planning on going
Lisa called me today
I didn't want to talk price with him
I was told to pick up the phone
I told him somebody would call him back
He wanted to move fast and he mentioned he used brokers in the past
If none are out I think we should call and tell him
Who is that and how do you know him
I haven't seen any come on since we sold some
What was his bid
I put it in my original message below
I imagine a natural
Are you going to call him today
Is he a broker or a natural
Everyone says they want to move fast then the jack around
You got his number
I told him we would get back with him
Please let me know if you do not call him
Nothing to tell him though
I just got back from the greenhouse gas meeting
John said he talked with you on the phone about the b-plan
I added a table of contents and if John gives me anything to add I will
I'm gonna keep it my little secret
From what I have heard this looks pretty good
So I think I shall
I called my boy at San Joaquin
Your girl okay with it
Go ahead and call your boy
Tell him we're checking on some things
I told him those ERCs on website were being sold
Cool what did he say
How much are the tickets going on your site
I am trying to buy one
We are scheduled to play our last game tomorrow night
Let me know by this afternoon if you can play tomorrow
Please bring your jerseys to the game
Can you forward any e-mail to me
I am trying to buy your Auburn ticket
I am going to use my Auburn ticket this weekend
I e-mailed them off of Universitytools.com
Last time I used Mindy's ID which may work again
Did anybody use my Ark ticket
I put my changes in red
While this statement makes reference to energy it seems to me it might also apply to metals transactions
I don't know if we have affected transactions or not
If so you may care about this
Really hurts me
But mathematical I still have a chance
I believe that there will be a demand for allowances
People think it is worse than it really is
Also I can make a price forecast
What else do you want here
But we are pretty much in that range
He mailed them out
Did you not get them
I am leading the league in fantasy
Wish I could play you every week
I think I'm still in first
One of his lines was a little out of wack
Derek said his computer at home would not pull it up
Bankruptcy is our other option
The firm needs to lay off people now as opposed to dragging it out
Any news about your job offer
Are you looking again
Hope you had a great thanksgiving weekend
I used it to check out NYC
Anyway what's your take on the future of the firm
And now it seems the merger is doubtful
Ok let me know if you got an extra ticket
I re-attached it for your review
Also I cannot get into my hotmail
Can you forward me any e-mails
Can you forward my e-mail
Since they don't need the change for them they see no reason to agree to it with us
Since this is for someone in the Governor's office I have no objection
How long do you want him to have access for
I hope you are enjoying your new job
I need to ask you for a favor
If someone can call me I will help orchestrate his registration
If you have not responded to me with your exception time please do so
Glad you are well
I hope you are not stranded somewhere
I made it back to Houston last night
So good it was London
I was worried because like me you travel so much
Not everyone is familiar with NYC geography of course and knowing I travel were concerned
Did you have any trouble
I'm surprised that under the circumstances American won't just do it
Of course in our cases the original flights were cancelled
I will get it for you when I get home
In a sense I felt safer in London than here
The sword rattling doesn't bother me too much
Mark -- I am trying to reschedule Amanda's return ticket
Do you have a contact over there
I want her to come home
Did you feel unsafe there
Thanks for your thoughts Mark
I may call you as well
I think we have it worked out
I was able to change the return flight to tomorrow
If we want that kind of protection it should be mandated not made possible by regulatory action
I have sent this to Brad and Greg as well
Thanks for making my morning
I think that's why they can't dock in ny
Has Amanda made it back yet
Has he moved into his new place in midtown yet
It is so amazing how lucky we were
But I have to find something better
Let me know if you need any further explanation
While I think the law actually works that way we have avoided putting it in writing so far
Mark May I have your permission to proceed with ordering a new desktop hard drive for Samantha Boyd
I need to order Samantha a new desktop hard drive
With your permission and Mark Taylor's permission what model do you suggest I order
I read about the Bid/Ask lawsuit
After more than three decades of living in Ohio I know how to be an Ohioan
While I was learning written guidelines would have been helpful
In fact Neil Armstrong almost took this casserole to the moon in case he encountered alien life there
Of Florida I mean
Or plan to when they retire
Ohioans love mulch and appreciate its subtle differences
When we do embrace them we do so with a Midwestern pragmatism
I hope you found this guide to be useful
I will meet you at the cafeteria downstairs
I have trouble with the second one
Can you call me on this one
Let us know if the language looks OK
I assume that neither will have any bearing on the SLA
Please give me a call if any questions
As far as I= know we have only had to do this once or twice
We do have mistakes from time to time as you suspected
I can't be on this call - do you have time
Please advise if you need a Hotel reservation
This way they can get Community Relations to match them
Would you kindly give me a call at your earliest convenience
Sounds like you have this under control
Please advise whether you are available for any of these times
I am available during either of the times proposed on Tuesday but not the Monday time
I never saw it
It came when I was out of town
Tel your Mom -thank you
Thanks for getting me the address
I hope you have a great Christmas vacation
Actually Aida may be the best broadway play I have ever seen

I will let Joe know that you received his care package
When I get my pictures developed I'll send you any good ones that may have turned out

Otherwise I will assume you will book the two tickets
Also Ican't find any of my bookmarks on internet explorer
Where do I find them
However they wanted some type of compensation if their volume was reduced
In other words if the producers used the delivery point they would pay max rate
If they did not they would not pay anything
This process is in its early stages of conflict
I will keep you advised of development
Jane any chance you or Randy or Tori could go to this meeting
Unfortunately I don't think I can make it and I've left Norm a voice mail message to that effect
However I'm not too optimistic about it getting rescheduled for next week

Can't believe what a small world it is
They upgraded me to a suite
Shame I was only there one night
She said you saw her picture of Matthew
Boy has it changed
I'm just sick over my tax bill this year
Can't believe there was another shooting in your area last week
Bet you are glad your kids are almost out of school
Deb and I had lunch with Julia
Her family still does not know she is married
She qwon't acknowledge to anyone that she is married
I've given up on her
She is almost as strange as you at times
Luckily I have not given up on you
You need to find out who he talked to
They have sent me a spreadsheet
If you need me to fax it please let me know
Can you also retouch the deal
Please call if you have any questions regarding this matter
ENA has decided not to extend the deal at their price
Please let me know if you agree with this penalty charge
Do you have an e-mail address at home yet
This is mine
One of my more emotional moments in the last few months
I told him to take pictures for us
If you are set up let me know. You and Joe could talk on it all night long
Do we only have an interruptible contract with them
Go ahead and change it
I received the fax
What do you mean by protesting-Are they not paying
Happy Valentine's Day to you as well
Maybe I can make a believer out of you
I want the penalty billed and let them challenge it
I got the pictures
However we are not going back off our view and will continue to bill based on scheduled volumes

I wondered why the restaurant was empty.
Thanks Pam This was sent to me by a friend
This seems so hard to believe doesnt it
This is a copy of our discussion today
Please review and if okay with you we can circulate to larger audience
Accordingly that means that Jeff and Leslie have priority to such lines since they are out of town.

If you do not have a primary contact or do not talk directly to the pipeline pls advise

I have received my world com card
I want the deep tissue massage
I forwarded it to our well-head specialist Nelson Ferrious
Let me know if you might have some interest
So when's the next FERC get together for our favorite pipe
I did not see this
I think they did a very good job in their comments
From past discussions we hope and anticipate that your company or client will be taking a similar position
Our goal is to still keep you all informed but in a more effective efficient and timely manner
This is where you and your group comes into play
We want what's relevant to you and your team
I hope you will be very happy in your new endeavors
Janie if you are satisfied as it is please run it by Mike Barry and Stephanie
I'm not sure we can file it electronically so it may have to be e-mailed to the D.C office
Jeff-can you review this and let me know what you think
I can't make any changes to this contract
I Hope most of you will respond
You will be happy with me

Please let me hear from everyone
I agree with your invitation list
Let me know if you want me to do it
I'll let you know if I reach Sherrie
I have not heard from Maria but I'm sure I will today
I think a photographer would be great for maybe an hour or so
What do you and Janie think
Neal/guest Maria/Larry andL eslie/Bob are you guys all in
As long as I know the deals ahead of time I can make sure they appear on separate invoices
Do you anticipate making these trades often
If they will be ongoing it will probably be easier to have two separate entities set up
Let me know if you want a copy of the original filing with maps etc
Please provide us with a copy of the filing and maps
Are we one of the shippers
I'm not sure I'm going to watch it

Can we imbalance trade this gas
As you know EPMI has been buying gas from the West Gas Desk for Harbor Cogen
We dispatch this plant and buy their electricity
I hate to give up business but it seems like we should unless we get a fair price
Please look it over and see what you think
I will call later today to discuss
Alternatively we have left it to the Commission to decide whether other procedures should be adopted
That is why it works
Can you please research and advise
Did you watch Michael Jackson yesterday
Laurie I have one problem on your invoice
Can you check your end
Also we need to discuss-if you forget tocall
If you forget to call the price between the gas and power desk needs to be negotiated
Also the gas desk will not be responsible for any imbalance penalties if you forget tocall
Otherwise I think it's a go
They are in your pool
This is bad for you guys
Under the new structure you only provide gas if we call
So let me know if the e new structure works for you given the answer to these questions
Call me with any more questions
If Jane does not agree have her call Mark Anderson

As noted in our conversation earlier today I apologize for the tardiness of my response
Very glad to finally hear from you
Sounds like you are happy= back in Austrailia
I would love to see it sometime
I hope you are there
Although I would understand if y= ou stayed where you are
I actually flew in from Denver on Monday night just = in time not to get stuck there
That meeting saved his life
I am so glad that he had= that meeting
I would have been devasted if something had happened to him=
However all of the people in their offices there are missing
It is sad that th= is thing has already affected our freedom some more so than others
Anyway I am glad to hear that you are well and having fun
I have another email address at home
It's beyond my realm of understanding
I hope life is treating you well and you are safe
It's so beautiful here and I am a little worried about the next war that is going to happen
Again I hope you are well and still loving this life
I met with the lovely Bruno Jeider last week
I asked him about SCE's impending bankruptcy
I asked him about his gas/power positions
I asked him about Burbank's power plant development
I asked him if he knew how to please a woman
In short if you plan to meet with Burbank make sure your meeting includes their traders
If there is anything else that you need in the meantime please give me a call
Kim I just wanted to touch base to see if you received the RFP
I got the RFP late and therefore I am running behind
I am attaching my proposal in case you need it
Even so - in your searching you might find someone better than me
But if I am still unattached I will be there
I don't know how well your weekend was but do I need to be looking for a new back-up
Didn't want to wake you up
How was your day yesterday
Anyway - I hope you have a good day today
And it is great that you get some $ for going
You can just let me know what you want to do
I think I would like santa clara first
Remember the collar spread that we looked at for tucson electric
Can we reopen that when you guys have time
Please let me know of any questions
Please call me with any questions and if we need to I can get credit on the phone
Jay we have talked about them before I think
Below is our RFP
As you know this is not a quick endeavor
I can start working on a Master Physical right away though
Do you have updated financial info from them
Let me know if you will be unable to attend
And they have asked me for this credit information twice today
I will try to investigate today
Are you aware of what's going on here
Please be sure we follow through
To answer your question I recommend confirming the gas EPME nominates
I also need gas for October
I will keep you posted on discussions
Antoher thing they brought up was locking in physical basis only
We can talk about the potential risks there if you want
I'll call you as soon as I talk to him
Thanks Mike we have left a message for Dave and are waiting to hear back from him
Also we are definitely willing to fix the physical basis for you and float on the Nymex
And this will help your credit cause
Let me know if you have a problem
Even with load growth and asset divestiture they wouldn't face the facts that the supply/demand picture was messed up
If you guys could work him from you end it could speed things up
Count us in and thanks
Now that air travel is somewhat back to normal Barry and I are rescheduling our trip to Southern California

Also I have attached a storage chart
Stephanie is checking with Transwestern to see what their parking/lending fees would be for weekends just for an idea
I am also talking to the desk
Please review and add anything you want and return
Extension until this time might require extension of our underlying deal
This would be OK with us
Why would they want this
I think that is what we proposed
As we have discussed weekends trade as the same quantity each day
If they want to have lower takes on Sunday this is more difficult ad increases costs
I will talk to you before I get own the plane
I hope it was not because of me
I slept fine
Buenos dias to you
I have yahoo
Do you have instant messenger of some kind

Isn't mine either
A carrot was something you left for Rudolph
I have my own list of tips for holiday eating
I assure you if you follow them you'll be fat and happy
So what if you don't make it to New Year's
In fact if you see carrots leave immediately
Drink as much eggnog as you can
You can't find it any other time of year but now
It's later than you think
If something comes with gravy use it
Pour it on
Make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes
Fill it with gravy
Lots of it
Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New Year's
You can't leave them behind
You're not going to see them again
Or if you don't like mincemeat have two apples and one pumpkin
When else do you get to have more than one dessert
Granted it's loaded with the mandatory celebratory calories but avoid it at all cost

Can I hear from you by noon or so today
I don't believe it was me
Kim and Linda would either you know if someone charged a lunch meal on Steve's Account at the Met
Linda would you check with your guys
She and I will work on this
Yes we now have a plan in place
If you have Rich's home address I would love to send him a note
Definitely not me
I would have charged a lot more than this
Dennis can we talk about this
Kim we have some units at Ivanhoe Station that have not operated in quite a long time
What are your thoughts on this request
Kim if you feel this is a reasonable request and legitimate please handle appropriately
Can you please pass onto to the appropriate personnel

I'll be looking forward in hearing from you
For your review and input here is the latest version of the LOI for Pemex

Until it does may we go ahead and plan a lunch or something nice for TK

Can you send me a list
I am not sure how this process works
Kim Please let's keep it small for right now
Please let me know of anything unusual
Can you and Tom swing these dates
I'm ok just working myself out of a job pretty quickly

Any of these sound good to us
Kim Do you have any write ups on the above projects that were discussed this afternoon
We will write these up and send them to you ASAP
Thank you so much for the reminder sometimes I think my brain has slipped away
If you know you have some of them which ones do you have I'll send you the rest
Please add Jan Moore to your distribution list
After Paul approves it I can sign it too
Additionally do we code the marketing fee revenues to a different account from the transportation revenues and how
My schedule is a little hectic tomorrow my afternoon looks a little better than the morning
Would you mind waiting until next week
By the way how did your testimony go on Big Sandy
Kim- Thanks for your recent message
I would look forward to visiting with you sometime Friday AM
Let me know if this works or perhaps next week some time
I will be in Denver M-W and then returning to my office on Th/F of next week
I looked through the list too fast
I'll keep you posted on our conversations
I trimmed down the model per your request
I will let you know when it is officially signed
I can't recall experiencing such generosity
You can then sell the extra fish you catch
With the extra revenue you can buy a bigger boat
I can't adequately explain to you what this self is
For us however reality is in the outer material physical world
Nothing is lost but its individuality is no more
Jesus knew that the ego was a great troublemaker for us
We cling to everything that we think defines us as individuals
To threaten this notion of who we are is hell
Those were the questions that shaped by the way what became our Bible
I love the story of the Pentecostal man who wandered into let us say a Methodist church
How can I keep quiet
And that's the problem with much of our theology
We wish he had the Holy Spirit
For one thing it has made people skeptical about spiritual reality
Second modernity has led us to be preoccupied with factuality - with scientifically verifiable and historically reliable facts
Listen carefully Faith has to do with your relation to God to Self
Not whether you believe the Bible to be true or not
Let me see if I can give you an example
What would Jesus have us do
And if so why aren't we doing what he asks us to do
Besides he had little political power
If we went to him and asked I think he would probably tell a story
I'll tell you something that might be misunderstood
That being the case what we must do is be human
If Jesus were here today would he have worked for Enron
Would he have been on the board of directors
If Jesus were here today would he go to church
Would he be a Republican or a Democrat
Would he be involved in the political process
Now love yourself like that
How do you do that
Look at the stories of his ministry
If a man can absolve a prostitute's guilt in lasting forgiveness he gives her the gift of self-respect
One of his central teachings was You shall know the Truth and the Truth shall set you free
Although all were polite toward each other they kept their distance
One day they went hunting together
Water meandered along cheerfully thinking about more cattle for itself
See for yourself
Let us leave Water who has cruelly destroyed our warmhearted friend
Water washed down upon itself splashing and swirling around rocks as it tumbled down the slope
You will be my servant
I am your master
And it has been that way ever since
Watch your step
Yes this interconnect will be managed by our E&C group
I got your phone message earlier this evening
I am looking forward to meeting and working with you also
The agreement looks fine to me
If anyone has any questions or concerns about the timing of these payments please give me a call
After execution we will forward a final copy to you for your files
Are you back in the office yet
Can you and Tom join us
Please call me let's discuss
John sorry for the late response but I think you can implement immediately
Do you think we need to do more
I was aware
I just couldn't remember if it was you or Terry
Are you comfortable with the difference
No hurry I was just wondering
Let's talk before I leave town next Wednesday
Kim Here is the Job Description and the Operational Accountabilities for the position I mentioned to you last Sunday
If you have questions or issues please let me know
It would be set to flow at a rate equal to their nomination I guess
As I said they intend to set this valve downstream of measurement on their pipe
Since it will be installed on their pipe I don't think there's much we can do about it
I wasn't sure who to contact about this
Would you please email me the final bullets from last week
Tiny is trying to complete his files
Kim I wasn't waiting on you
As a matter of practice would you automatically email me the final bullets document after Steve approves
Shirley please keep me posted on Krishna's new baby
If they have any questions on material have them call me
I am currently routing it for approval for TW's signature
If putting a hold on this meter would help improve the in-service date I would definitely recommend it

I will be on vacation for this meeting

I'm sending you a map via your hotmail account
I think that would be great however I would like to discuss with Steve for approval on the expense

Does this impact us
If you are currently using another company please begin using WorldCom Conferencing for your audio conference needs
I am following -up on this
While we have capacity the field doesn't see much happening to bring customers back or to get new customers
The customer told the field employees that ETS was releasing gas to them not our commercial group
I must be sleepy this morning.?

Hey darlin' did one of us make a credit card call from Newark airport
Will you be able to attend and give us your advise

Jean It will be very beneficial if you could come up with the names

I will follow= up on this later today
Did that procedure work for you
Not sure I can swing Friday yet
I might be able to leave early
I am definitely game for attending
Does it start on Friday and go through Sunday
Can we meet with him on Tues

Can you follow up with the marketing on this
I contacted Mr Bradly for the locations and vols
I attempted to contact both of you via phone and was unsuccessful hence the e-mail
Although we skimmed the surface on board replacements for Jim we should probably start a list of potential candidates
I believe Dave N and Sue had a conversation regarding help in the risk mgmt area
Also James has been running numbers today so I should have a term sheet for you tomorrow

You may consider my request withdrawn
We thank you for your time and assistance
I would not foresee any inconvenience with anyone using it
Sorry I did not get to call last night
When Melissa gets her pictures developed can you see if they can put them on a CD

Okay the results are in and they are ugly
So far I have had no confirmed response for this event
Campus recruiting is fun but it also takes dedication and team work
If you are looking for a free trip to Austin you should go to this
I finally awoke sometime later
You were cracking me up when I called the other evening
I purchased some really good books on web marketing
I will send you copies of the details for your review
If you want to give her more then you can put it toward a Christmas present or something
Are you going hunting this weekend
I got your e-mail
Melissa is better not totally well but may be on her way to recovery
Sorry we are no longer tracking overtime since you are salary based
I assume whoever needs this info has one
Anyway take a look and let me know what you think
Note conference room for our meeting today
Note their performance yesterday in light of apparently good news
That's what I will remember about him most
He said he and Stacey were going to the funeral
I emailed Stacey and told her I hoped she was ok
Anyway I don't know how you feel but if you are sad I hope you are ok also
I guess I would have shot him
Attached you can find a load factor analysis for Stagecoach
Anyway I hope you'll are doing great and let me know about my contribution
I have a structuring class all day
Can we keep this under wraps for now
I just bought some more CPN
I think the ranch was owned by Jimmy Powell
More fawns than I ever remember
I bought them based on industry strategy and PEG
FYI - I created a folder for all Stagecoach files in...GasStructuring\Stagecoach
I plan to attend as a greeter if needed
I'm always ready to crap but if you want assistance pre-crap then let me know.

I am now completely out Intel and did trim some other
I would recommend selling Intel today

We have the authorization to do it this way
Are you going to invite the others
I will send out a final email if needed

He could be a Bettis type back if he stays committed

Among other things they mention that they had tough comparisons due to an active storm season the year before
Please let me know how I may be of assistance
Does it mean rising junior or completed junior
Here's the link to the gas fundamentals website that I mentioned
It has a wealth of information on it some of which the group can hopefully utilize
Anyway definitely keep all of this confidential between me and you
I'm sure you see my point of view here
I hope you had a good holiday season
I will be sure and send you a meeting before then
Did you go to lunch with Juan Verde
No did you
Why don't you buy deep in the money put options
Did I figure this right
I won't be the one to put it out there
Additionally we need to go further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn't decline
On the marketing front I am certainly open to ideas
Given our positive relationship that we currently have with them they might be the easiest sell
As a result we expect investors once again to seek the shelter of well-capitalized defensive plays like Enron
I don't disagree with your view but I wouldn't count broadband out yet
By the way I doubled up on JPM today
I'm here now if you want to give me a call

Sounds like a good deal to me
We'll see what they say
Who's your -uckin' daddy
Lavorato and the Texas desk head are discussing it

I got the job on the Texas Desk
I went to UT with George
I think he is defintiely worth interviewing
Enclosed is my resume
Thank you very much for the help
He proposed a very interesting idea and I'd love to get your feedback on it
My instincts tell me that subcontracting would be easiest right now
Plus if the relationship turned out to be unworkable then we simply stop doing business with them
If some folks in their region might not know them but they might be familiar with GOPUSA
Can I get Michael Finger's phone number
I've had no luck finding him

John I'm afraid I don't have a whole lot of detail
Can you give me some background info on these deals below
Are they supposed to
Will they be clearing anytime soon
I don't know where all those pictures are
We received them online so I am sure they are lost
Donnie may have them
Remember he was dressed as Austin Powers
Do you know if that is still floating around anywhere
Which one will you be
Can you send me an example
It's not as detailed as you may be thinking
Are you currently preparing option sensitivity reports for Matt Motley
Who do you have working on this
Please let me know how often you need data like this
In July Mr Fastow formally severed his connections to LJM
Thank you so much for the invite
Which ancillary curves are you referring to
Do you agree with synopsis
Frank the ancillary curves data are not liquid so we can not assign them as primary curves presently
Using jumps would be appropriate for them
How urgent is it to start calculating VAR on them
Susan I am so sorry I am doing this
Does that answer your question
Also will you get Tim to give direction on what traders will be allowed to trade what regions
I wanted to thank you for spending time with me yesterday
Who is your contact in Liquids
For our morning meeting
Just wanted you to see this correspondence
I can easily put in prices for the earlier months
I can put the prices in today
Can you do either of the below
I appreciate your help in working toward a solution
Please invite anyone I may have missed
Stacey I need to get the ENA Cal files for December
It may be that they are not there yet
Zhiyun was working with the RAC IT she would know the latest
I have tried sending you emails but they always come back
Are you still attending these meetings
Let me know if this does not work
Therefore the change must not be my request
Please let us know if you have any concerns
If you don't mind ask Tim if he has made any decisions on the video conferencing
I met with her last Thursday and it was a good meeting
It is totally liquidated so no one will have to worry about it anymore
How would you like me to handle this question
Please review the positions in your group's section
Believe it or not this is something that he has wanted
He seemed to really like it
Thanks to all you for the back-pack
I needed a new one
My daughter had taken my old one
You make my job easy
John What is the phone number where we can reach you
Sorry I do not have an itinerary
Can you let them know you will be doing this
Did you ever get an answer for Frank
Does it really deserve that backwardation
I will talk to Tim re Jeff Richter's Schedule C reserve and get back to you
I agree with this request
One issue I have relates to the 'Trading Location' field
I am going to make the changes tomorrow
Have you heard any more regarding the PGE sale
It's funny here nobody is talking about it
By the way when I saw Casey that girl is getting skinnier by the day
I have never personally seen her that thin before
How was your flight
Did you feel safer
They want me to go on the London Doorstep in November so I was just wondering
I forwarded to Murray to get some back ground info
I understand all the following except the Index-Option
Why would it be treated as a Spread-Option
Where did she get this information
Theresa Can you find out where the loss was booked
Do we need to get together to discuss this
Yes she is actually down here right now and I am showing it to her
Jeff please ask your assistant to enter all data but not to submit the churn
Do we need to have our assistant put in churn requests or wait until this is all settled
Please phone me with any questions
I know he would love to see all of you
Sounds good I will abide
When filling vacancies I would like to have each of you review the positions
I would like to sign off on all replacements
I promise not to be difficult
Have them go through accounting
Not our area unless it runs through the DPR
As earnings release is quickly approaching we would appreciate your prompt assistance
Did you send this to Kathy reeves
Dave Can you please approve or reject Samantha's request
If you are not comfortable approving it then reject it so she can resubmit
When I went into the system today it said it had already been assigned to you
Stacey Stacey So do I need to re-submit the request then
Looks like this one went to Stacey with me as her backup
I am not sure there is anything we need to do just wanted to keep you in the loop
I have put the following test deals in the PWRTESTP environment
Everything on my side looks good
Please test the effects on your downstream systems as well as forward this e-mail to anyone I have forgot
I don't really like what they are suggesting either
I think the idea of having two books stinks
Stacey I believe the below email comes from AA
Please review and let me know if it's appropriate
Can you please make this change in your tables
Please let me know when the process is complete
I forwarded this meeting to Casey
I will be out of the office
Hopefully you will be able to make it to this
Let me know what other detail you need
As you can see from various e-mails Samantha will need to take responsibility for these twice weekly calcs
I am expecting that you will want to use my risk estate employees for this I am correct
If anyone anticipates any problems with this time frame please call me or Shona to discuss
Good luck in all your future ventures
Good luck to all of us
This should answer your regional trading question
I do not have this same information from the West
Once we receive this information we will be applying the names and testing the products
I certainly do not anticipate that we will
I hope the Estate people are designating someone for this
I am going to look into it
So like will we be doing this after we start at UBS
Can you please add to the m drive a first tier directory of common
Please let me know ASAP that this is complete
Who do we ask to set up the m:\common
This makes the most sense to me
In UBS system it is changed to M:\power
I think your resume looks good
Brad called me today and they are definitely pulling together resumes
Actually it would be me
Is this person willing to send her resume to me
I'd gladly take her call as well
She is very well qualified for a management position her resume should speak for itself
Also power books are set up as you have defined below
Please let me know so I can reserve a room
FYI - it is NSTAR
Please update me on the answer to the following e-mail
Do you know if they got these same numbers from John
Make sure you talk to Casey & John
I will be out of the office for a UBS orientation
Do you think we should get Sonia to update this
Can you go to this meeting in the morning
I have two others at this same time
If it does get changed I will be there tonight
I finally talked to him also
The message you just told me is what I communicated to Samantha
Whenever or if ever you find out more specifics re Portland estate please let me know
Sorry I can't be more specific
Also please let me know the message you are sending to 'estate' employees in Portland
I would like to communicate the same message to Samantha
All right we have tried to almost complete a whole month without seeing eachother
Kelly we might make a small exception for you
I think we should start off with a small novella written by Steve Martin
Ya'll will just have to hear all about it
Thank you so much for this query
At this time I am not sure what happened to the numbers in our spreadsheet
The good thing is it works now
Was it from DPR or some other spreadsheet
The following spreadsheets represents the final product from our request
It looks good for me
Have you told Kathy about this transfer
Should it be a bankruptcy book
I moved it to a Alberta ENA book
Currently expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week
Are they working on it
John did it work for Portland
How much do I owe you
Did you get your sandwich yesterday
I totally agree
It seems that nobody even knows what those applications are and so they will not be migrated to NetCo
To my knowledge East Volume Management does not use any of these applications
Do you know any of the following applications
What they are used for and who uses them
I also updated the comment
I don't know of any group that would use this
Russell and I are both well probably working too hard
I tried the number listed on this e-mail for you but it just rang and rang
Wasn't sure if you wanted to read the whole letter
Here it is if so
I would talk to Lee at BR I know he is under water with the Canadian Hunter acquisition
I think I would talk to Kinder Morgan
Mark Mark Hope all is well with you guys in Denver
I assume Lee Hanse is still with them
I was going to send him an e-mail with my resume
When would you like me to begin
I invited her over for dinner on Friday
I liked that wedding even more than ours
That woman is wearing the same outfit as I am
Honey isn't tonight your night out with the boys
You passed out before brushing your teeth again ya' big silly
You are so much smarter than my father
Are you sure you've had enough to drink
I love it when you change channels all the time
If you need me I'll be out painting the house
No no I'll take both of our cars to have the oil changed
Your mother is way better than mine
Actually I don't have your number
I don't bite
Haven't heard form you in awhile
This is still rough but it is a little better
Don't tell her I sent you this
What's up with your friend
PT...reminds me of the circus are you really that much fun
Besides the afro what else have you picked up for your costume
So incredibley cool that we agree on the same ground rules
I'm sending big wet kisses your way...LOOK OUT
You scare me
So...you never call you don't write
Did the security video scare you off
No worries I won't hurt you
Worsley you might even be able to find a woman with this kind of service
Or if you prefer I hear they have some cute goats
I am booked all of this week
Steve would that be possible for you
I know that is beyond your two week window but it would be the best time for me
It would have been fun but I definetly plan to be at the Little Bear that Friday night
Got any work I can do from home
How is my Paulie today

We are pretty flexible so let me know what works for Patina
If you have questions about our comments give me a call
I will send you the project summary
I will be available for a meeting in Denver
Maybe we can schedule something around that date
You can if you want but you may not get paid
Anytime in particular that I should be there
If you could get to me between now and the early part of next week that would be great
What time are you meeting today
Do you want me to participate
It was nice meeting you and your associates yesterday
Depending on your accounting method that money would probably be amortized over the term of the contract
Let me know what you think perhaps we should have our accountants talk
No changes to mine
If FedEx and UPS were to merge would they call it Fed UP
You never really learn to swear until you learn to drive
Last night I played a blank tape at full blast
If a cow laughed would milk come out her nose
I only added one line otherwise it looks good
I wish I was that smart
Didn't want to inflame him as he masterminded the whole thing
These are only the newest additions to our WEB ONLY inventory
I will be your contact

I can see Ken and his boys going to jail
I like those kinds of schedules
Heidi Please sum up my costs and Paul's cost for this trip and forward to Barry
But we will sum it up for you
Any suggestions before I respond to this
I'll get you the particulars tomorrow

I thought you might want to consider that as well
Should I go
I would just love to do that
Let's talk it through
Please review and share your comments and concerns
Let me know what time would work for you on Tuesday
We think we might have a structure worth looking at
Therefore we need to have the contract assigned to us
Based on last night's mids it looks like our mini book valuation/reconciliation is pretty tight
Mark--here's the article that I mentioned this morning
Call and we can discuss
I am so sorry about Jack
To me Jack was everything a man was supposed to be
He could always put a smile on your face
I know this is hard for you and the girls
It is hard for me to write this without breaking up
I Love you guys and wish I was there with you
I did but I didn't activate it
I have forwarded this to our credit department
If you did not receive that letter please notify me as soon as possible
Sorry you are correct
Did he ever have any taste
Are you sure your info is correct
I am a little surprised by Marathon
I don't recall a fax number
You won't believe this but this really does give you the answer

Should it be you two we contact
Did we get any of the Devon volume in Houston
Just wanted to let you know how Brian was responding

Shows the state of the industry doesn't it
Oh-- so now your a 'Distinguished' speaker
Look forward to your talk
That gave us a good chuckle this morning
I made one change
But click quick because like the holidays these items will be gone before you know it
I know this could be much more thorough but I just wanted to shoot it out to you asap
Thanks again so much for being willing to even consider me
I have changed the dates and prices in these agreements but those should be the only changes necessary
Just got this - don't know if there is anything here but thought I'd move it through in case
How does my resume look
Are you still thinking a temp
Still think you need me in your office though
I put this together in preparation for meeting Monday afternoon
We can discuss at your convenience

I am not sure about lunch
I may already have plans
Having major problems with my server for some reason
How much time should I plan on spending down there
Let me knowif there is anything else you need from us
I made one slight change
Sounds like we are still in the hunt
Thanks for the update we will coordinate with Jason while you are out
You know we are confident we will straighten things out soon
Dow you want to split it pro-rata based upon headcount
You can bill us afterwords
However you want to work it is fine with me
I knew I could count on your support
Did you see what happened today
I'm sure it is sad
This is a lesson for those of us who are younger
I just have a hard time believing it is real
I didn't know you were living in an apartment
What do you mean repair or rebuild
I hate to hear about you and Nadine
Not sure I want to work for this new regime
I guess it all comes down to money
How's your clan
Girls driving you nuts
Wow I didn't know that you got flooded
If it was me I think I would start looking for one of those Russian Mail Order brides
Aren't you still running
If not you need to start
If not for your body do it for your mind
Tropical storm Allison did us in
Without Meaghan I would have been gone long ago

Let me know if anything comes up
Usually it is pretty good so try and bring something
Now to the hard part - I have to find one
Let me know when they show up
Did you see Tim
However I doubt that they're ready to come out of the closet
I'm sure Lucci would escort her
I need to finalize this count as soon as possible
So it is imperative that you let me know
Unfortunately he was at a meeting
I thought that was classic
Nadine comes to our house today
Did you get all the articles from the Houston paper
Have you seen this one

As always you are the consumate proffesional
Are you sending out Xmas cards

Hope you all have a great Thanksgiving
How was your trip this weekend
Did you get a chance to check into the Montaneros Lodge
What did you think
All of a sudden a fox appeared jumped on the rabbit and ate it
The next day after eating some more dung he reached the second branch
Finally after a fortnight there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree
Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer who shot the turkey out of the tree
Management Lesson Bullshit might get you to the top but it won't keep you there
So the asshole went on strike blocked itself up and refused to work
Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be the Boss so the motion was passed
While it was lying there a cow came by and dropped some dung on it
I can then grant you access to view the reports online
Mark I don't think you have any capital expenditures but you're welcome to join in on the call
I will send out the dial-in number tomorrow morning

Group As most of you are aware we changed time zones on Sunday
As such we are once again in a different time zone than some of our counterparties
See me if you have any questions regarding this expectation
Do you have any feedback on the candidates
I am attaching an other CAISO document on this topic
If you want a briefing on these changes please let me know
Though designed to resolve the price overlap there are certain difficulties with the TP as it was implemented
Mike Your cell phone is not working or has been disconnected and I have no way to reach you
Please update me with your contact information as soon as possible
And I appreciate your understanding
I appreciate your understanding
If that's the case then maybe I should just start taking the other three weeks of the month off
That completely defeats the purpose of my taking time off
Definitely...to begin with he should be Michael Mier
Could we please rename Michael Miers Profile
Julie I received this message yesterday from a student group at the University of Washington
Bill Bill Williams As you know the Dow Dawgs are an Investment Club at the University of Washington
We will however work with your schedule and move the meeting to a different day next week
I am waiting for more information on UBS
Sounds like a good market to sell to while it lasts
Group Here is some input from Tony at EPE regarding running their system
Bill thanks for the visit we enjoyed it
In order to do this we need to tighten up our real-time operations
I will indicate in an email to you when this occurs
Also EnMax has recently been buying energy from us at the BC Border
Any questions just let me know
David Poston showed the position manage= r to me Cara Semperger and Phil Platter
Please give me a call when you have a chance
Thank you Les
OR we will deliver or take energy from them at Mid-C
Please see me with any questions
Paul Here is an updated version of the agreement I sent to Steve on Friday
Sorry I didn't cc you to start with
It's pretty much exactly as we discussed
First With EPE we will start seeing a severe morning ramp
Second The morning ramp will soon be upon us in the Northwest
Please see me with any questions regarding the system
Good afternoon I have attached a draft of the Control Area Services Agreement to this email
I understand we may not implement it for a while
I appreciate your time and feedback
Group- WWP is good to buy and sell with us again
It's cold its wet its raining
Yes the question is ambiguous but try to go with it
Hopefully I will be out of GH soon
I have not been working on my tan
First I did get both your resume and letter and have taken it to our Human Resources department
We can go over the others when we speak next
I am looking forward to the interview and assuming I do well am anxious to get started
So let me know about a timeline when you can please
Do you do any trading in gas
Do you move any Canadian electricity
We sell energy to Canadian entities frequently though we do not schedule the energy into Canada
We deliver the energy to them at the BC-US border
Yes it means we do not have to spend months unwinding trades
In short its good for Enron--and everyone else who bought and sold energy in the NW
Will this have any effect on you
To put it bluntly will you still be able to hire from the outside
What does Enron think of that or do they care
What happens if it goes bankrupt
I believe it is minimal on the trading desk
The acronyms are incredible but they all make sense after a while
I then called Mike at SRP marketing after speaking with Linus
I then called SRP transmission to discuss the schedule with them
He told me he would call his marketer
Please let me know what you find out regarding this practice
If you have any questions for me please let me know
Sandra Please update your email list to read Bill Williams and not Bill Williams III
Steph Great to hear from you
Enron selling PGE has had no real effect on me
It should be good for our stock price though
Glad to hear you guys are doing well
And my liver will likely always be in shape
How is your place
I am sure you have carried on the tradition
Work for me is the same
Actually I think the Honda is probably the one
Catherine I believe this was meant for Bill Williams in Technical Assets
Please let us know so E-Next can budget accordingly
Also please verify with Lisa Kathleen and Billy that they are OK with the form Change Order
John Thank you for the letter and for the resume
Attached you will find a letter to you and on a following email I will send my resume
Very much looking forward to further discussions at your earliest convenience
Although Duke has various options as to how they will take care of the traded obligation

I will be out of the office from Wednesday through Friday
If you trade in the future with either of these CPs please book them with = the appropriate CP

However I am on my way out the door to Pullman WA for a recruiting trip
I would like to discuss this further with you sometime today
Let me know when you are free
The compensation issue is still under review by our management
Michael I think you intended to send this to Bill Williams in Technical Assets
At Enron these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment
If you do the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively
Chip Could you send me a list of Turret ID's for the guys in the real-time group
If the customer is interested we can negotiate a more formalized contract for this service
If I change my mind though I'll give everyone plenty of notice
THis works for me
So does no response mean I have approval
Without that your notes are pretty much worthless
If this sounds unreasonable I would welcome suggestions for an alternative
Paul Thanks for the invitation but I will not be able to attend on Friday
Also I will be opening a double magnum of chardonnay
Email me if you can come and how many are coming
Darren Just let me know when you have time and we will set it up
I thought that locational market power was addressed via RMR
Of course you were
Don't feel bad though we all get confused at times
Some of us just more than others
I was referring to you
HUBRIS The elevation of pomposity to such bloated and seemingly irrelevant levels as to transform it to stupidity
Just give me a call with any questions
I believe the old PMax was approx
If you need to switch days feel free
If you have any problems call David Poston
Please...remove me from your list
I am not involved with security in Houston or otherwise and can not help you obtain a security badge
Please remove my name from whatever list you might have
This should greatly improve our settlements process and minimize disputes
Granted most of your group goes way over that
I need information regarding our monthly cell phone costs
Jill Could you also cancel my monthly PalmNet service

I would like to implement all of these practices immediately
I am looking for more suggestions for improvements on our process

As always let me know if you have questions about this

Who loves you baby
Please see me with questions
I know we have several new traders and details often get overlooked in the midst of the learning process
If you don't purchase the energy in a particular book you don't have energy to sell from that book
Most importantly if you are unsure call someone who is not
Thanks again for your attention to these matters
Although we are not the only group that uses tobacco products we are the most visible
The symbolism was not lost on him
They told him to bring his last paycheck and a resume Mead said
He worked six weeks he said before he finally got a contract to sign
But unlike Mead most of the new crew had never bought power before according to their resumes
The state traders were powerless however to protect themselves
I prefer to not enter these extra deals
Alan I think you have identified the most pressing issues
Feel free to let me know if you have any questions
The California ISO has begun a comprehensive redesign of its markets
Also we will need to be on the defensive against the ability of CAISO to impose price controls
I am unsure if ST-CALI is doing anything
Let me know if you have questions and you may want to check prices with these desks
Please remove me from this list
If it is not please forward me the correct info
Guys You can find out the information you need on the website
Print off the schedulers course manual and study it
Murray We tally up our exposure each day based on the California flash
We are keeping a very close eye on it
At this point I think that we are underestimating expenses
Consequently we will not buy or sell it on your behalf to capture it
Please give me a call tomorrow for a more thorough explanation
Scott I had not heard from you in a while and was wandering what you might be up to
Have we been accused of this from them
As indicated we got that exact amount in the flash today
Jim I just wanted to bring to your attention the volume of congestion that we relieved last night
Dave I would like to restrict access to this directory
Yeah I am taking a look at it
If you want to meet me for lunch we can grab some pens and go over the thing
I am going to need information from you and find out what you want to show

According to BPA we are almost their on Grays

Geir Here is your interview schedule for tomorrow

Haven't heard from you in forever
Hope you had a good new year
Drop me a line and give me the word

Thank you Kate
Could you please add his name to the list as well
Chip will grab you if he sees you

Kate Symes needs another handset under her desk as well
Also I need to have my extension displayed on Kate Symes turret and on each RT turret as well
I will address our treatment of handsets with the group
I have discussed our lack of handsets with Dave Steiner
These handsets will be labeled Real-Time this should prevent others from switching out our handsets
I think you know
So do you mean we have to call EVERY hour
I am meeting with Warren on Tuesday
Then we need to call BPA and communicate the ACTUAL energy generated not an estimate
Les has provided us with the needed information for each day
And yes we will be compensated by the Services desk for our work
Last time I checked no one could tell the difference
Last time I checked I was not a gentleman
I apologize for misinformation on my part regarding these units
If you have questions please see me otherwise...spread the word
Please ask if you have any questions
Kate I think we need to enter the buy from EPE flat to our day ahead sale to STSW
After this is done we can import HA finals and create the HA report
Sometimes it helps to pull the missing hour-ahead finals in individually
The first sentence bothers me
I've never lent anything from anyone in my life
If this works for you please copy and paste it into your own email and send it on
If you have any questions concerning this procedure please call me
Kate We need to move you more towards a trading support role and less of a settlements role
Take your time but have a good weekend
If you have any questions or have further feedback just let me know
Bill You think I could do it
I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now
Understandably people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation but really there isn't a good one
He paid himself huge sums of money but he also made huge sums for his firm
Milken created an operation which was if anything much more profitable than it looked
Why did Enron which made its money as an intermediary invest in this stuff in the first place
I don't know where you planning on going
If you are I may not
Kate I will not have time today
Perhaps it can wait till tomorrow
Amy I added a sentence describing the potential for this position to be temporary
In case it does the site is www.powerpool.ab.ca
I am available at any point this morning including now

When you have a second I would like to ask you a question or two

I should be back Wednesday afternoon
You can reach me on my cell phone if you need
Let's get Nate on the team he would be great addition
Group A quick note regarding Pace transmission reservations on their oasis sites
There are two things we need to do to prevent this
One Submit our transactions correctly the first time
Hopefully this will prevent the extra charges or give us a means to pull tapes and contest the charges
Considering the circumstances if we don't move up I think we should just move up to the first division
As a lover of european soccer I enjoy the promotion/relegation system
I'm all for it
Afterall we deserve it
So if you know of anyone really good have him join
Also send me money
Finally I would recommend printing the CAISO tariff off and reading it over the weekend or next few weeks

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback
Decremental Supplemental Bids We can submit dec bids to the ISO at a price below your cost to generate
Then if the ISO takes the incremental bid you can generate the power and sell for additional profit
This brings us back to the age-old question
During an emergency how we can tell what the highest price paid for energy by California is

I compile the following for Brian Redmond
It seems like I haven't seen you or Scott forever
If we are bought out we should be back up and running by early spring
Anyway hope you are doing well and are all ready for the holidays
Virginia I also had a question on a PMA from January
I think we need to go through this
I cannot print to Valena currently
I have attached the presentation that Dave will give
David Try to make sure you get these to me rather than to my Dad
I think he is starting to get annoyed
Tim I gave the money to Debra
No money on this one but I don't think it should take over a week to train the users
Good afternoon How are you
Portland has been nice the last couple days though its been raining like crazy
In fact I am taking tomorrow off and getting in a bit of golf
If its a clear morning I should be able to see Mt
Hope the pic makes it to you through our firewall
I apologize for our mistake
I don't know if you recieived my other msg
Let me know so I can get the order in
I called and put in the order for your headset
I told them to send it ASAP
I also called about the little wall problem
Would you mind if I let the group know that
The grievances were either turned down or settled he said
That's an insult to my skill
SDG&E would also vary the plant's output but not as dramatically as Duke did they said
Al I can be a reference for both Eric and Steve
Are you willing to be reference for them
Al Alan I just want to pass on the two names I had mentioned previously to you
BUT I would encourage you to E-mail Tim Belden or Stacey White and ask them these same questions
Cara - When you get a moment could you tell me what this Power Audit is for
Does Arthur Andersen work for us
Let me know what you know
These deals are all West Hourly deals and can be researched by Kate Symes our real time coordinator
We are in the final stage or our audit so your quick response would be greatly appreciated

So work was solid today got just about everything accomplished that I wanted to
And as for a picture I'll see what I can do

But I'm writing you now
I just pray that I won't get too busy today
I took a Sunday shift today didn't I
Let me share with you the dilemma
I want to go soooo bad
Well I just got off the phone with you so you actually know all about the about issues above
I don't think I can send my picture on this computer
I'll try but it may not work

So what do you think happened last night
How did the EOL trades mess us up
Just curious as to how it is flowing
She probably just shows it a bit more
We shouldn't be holding you guys back too much longer
Please notify me when these changes will be effective

Lanegan died in his sleep last night

Its worrisome but like I said I am optimistic

So do you still have a job
If you have access
As we have more and more cuts we have an excellant opportunity to refine our cut technique
IF you have any questions please call me
I need your help with some Enpower applications
These should be the only congestion wheels that we run
And we still need to calculate our daily position
I appreciate your help and diligence
Please inform me of any changes

In my abscence she can go to Lei Pete Matt or David about questions regarding the EnPower Data
Please see me with any question
I have also not been able to approve these
Mike I am not the approver for these rights
I immediately called SRP back at that point
When the issue was brought to my attention by EPE gen
In retrospect I should have given the tag# to Jose
I will not need any food ordered
Will you need any food ordered
Samantha I've already added you to the list
Kysa Just wanted to give you a quick heads up
I like that much better...super
I think that's what I gave you
I just didn't know what to call it
I appreciate the goals and accomplishments I was looking more for a quick outline of duties
Here's an initial draft of my daily activities and accomplishments
I did this fairly quickly so I may be adding to it on Wednesday
I am considering participating with Dow Jones
Following are a few pointers to help you get started
I got a hard copy of your inc sheet and the above is what I calced for yesterday
I know Jim
We haven't missed it for a long time but thanks for the heads up
Jill Could you look into my concur expense login/password
Also we are a go for Edgefield
You and I just need to talk about the expense report
And what are you trying to recall
Come on...don't try to run me over
Please deposit at my desk
We'll finally have the pimpin' leader that we need
You are a piece you dolt
Where do you want to have dinner
Perhaps the answer then is to work with the flaws between the pieces as well as the pieces themselves
Initially I am just curious if you can achieve a decent correlation
I appreciate whatever help you can provide
If this is a customer you are familiar with let me know
I need the general location and/or zone
There is a Northend Balancing but it has no volume
Better see you bud
Unfortunately my irritation does not reach that far
This may be best answered by whomever schedules your supply
Also it would be extremely helpful if you could tell me when the above plants closed or reduced capacity
Keith - I believe this is for you
Also I would like to confirm the DRNs for the other three
If you or someone you could refer me to could provide this information I would greatly appreciate it
The only Big-Unit I recognize is the one from UH me
And yes I am with Beth
And yes I am still a stud-cowboy
I don't clean boats damnit
I manufacture them from powder form polyethelene
I bake them in big rotating ovens
Notice how I answer all of the questions you asked
Can you clean my boat
Just building them
Tara got her offer from Enron
I like them for the series
Are you cleaning fishing boats too
This is my new work e-mail
Capron filled me in on your quest for a Vegas trip
Are you and Beth together or apart at this time
I really could just flip a coin and get as accurate an answer as you would give me huh
Take it easy hombre
He offered me a raw water washdown
And I don't own a boat
If the FBI had ANY concern about this we would see it on the news
I'm sorry I didn't receive the text of your reply
Thank you very much for your understanding
Mark I am transferring funds to Paypal which will take a couple days
I recently won two of your auctions
I am excited about these posters but I have a couple questions
I just got back from checking out the new building
We hadn't heard from you in FOREVER so I thought I'd see what you are up to
I also have some Enron questions for you
I know it is confusing
What index curves do you need
I am still waiting for your reply
I can get these curves as soon as they get it
I will not be able to get these curves
I can get Yesterdays Index curves
Why we are not playing AOE today I do not know
If you could give me some contact information I would appreciate the help
I am interested in gas load by residential industrial and electrical generation on a weekly or monthly basis
Also if possible a list of the larger generators or industrials that you serve
They must wear silent shoes so that they are never heard
Women live in fear of their lives for the slightest misbehavior
Depression is becoming so widespread that it has reached emergency levels
Others have gone mad and were seen crouched in corners perpetually rocking or crying most of them in fear
Everyone has a right to a tolerable human existence even if they are women in a Muslim country
I love you and although I am seemingly incorrigible I listen to your criticisms
I listened to you then also
Also I expect you to do some holiday visiting with me and vice versa
This would really show how much things have not gone your way and would be a reminder for me
We could also set up a Jay jar but I guess that would be less full
I am brainstorming to try to get myself to behave so I know it's corny
Also I like the VIrginias and Carolinas but we should go together when we go
And I think of you as my partner every day and I'm sorry I take it for granted
I have an overwhelming need to leave
I am highly frustrated but you don't seem to listen
I need to do something about the situation because it is NOT improving
I am tired of bitching complaining criticizing being hurt and most of all not being taken care of
You do not treat me like a friend half the time much less a partner
I think that the Virginias or Carolinas would be a nice place because of the climate location schools etc
I would like to go there establish residency and maybe go to school
Otherwise I would just like to leave by a house and build a little bit of security
I need something
OK We can try it
I applied for jobs today
But for the most part I would characterize the game as a draw
A good beating reminds me of my uncle Sam's place
I look forward to an evening of intense concentration puncuated by controlling berating direction
If Beth OKs it I can do a strategy session
And to seal us off
Thus he has a constant wave of attacks
Whenever we hang out not attacking it's over
I think that means setting team members' priorities for army segments
He always sees where we are
We never know where he is
So who can play with me tonight
I will give you many hugs
A director was mean to me today and made me cry
Another director was talking to me about it
That was why I was not available for your call
Please do not call and ask me about it
I talked to Geof and got the OK
Jason did you get a chance to talk to Geof Storey about using the Flexible Deal Viewer

I miss those days
Coal fuels most of its electricity generation
Another subsidiary provides insurance for Illinova and its other businesses
PumpnGD had a lucky defensive game but he has good people as well
Curtis Martin is a bye for him so he picked up Watters
But you saw last night how dominant Shaun Alexander is
If he has a good game next week he may have the starting role or at least split carries
He got lucky / we need a better defense
I need to be where the trading is
Beth and I are driving up for XMas
I am corrected--thanks
What do you think about Illinova
I guess that means it's game night
I think that reveals the true inner warlike nature of MillerKnight
So have we got a full room for tomorrow
Are you guys just going business as usual for now
Man who woulda thunk it
If you lose your job you wanna open a bar with me and Clay
I have forgotten my PIN
Have you seen the new Ford Thunderbird
Go online if you haven't and have the big guy look at it too
I think it looks pretty awesome but I'm not sure it will be my next car

Did you watch the Cowboys game yesterday

Sounds kind of vague to me
In case you guys didn't have a copy
This is an internal draft for our review
Should we stick with the single transaction
I made that up and no one has ever commented on it
There may be some other minor points but I think that this is most of it
Travis I will call you tomorrow afternoon
Can you please fix
Sorry for the delay in getting back to you but you know how things are
I heard about Sonny
Thank you again for your support on this event
Can I get a Reuters screen as well
We now have the complete API to them but it is hooked up to their test environment

I assume Webb is for it
If he is then it is a strategic decision
I talked with Greg and he and bibi are for it

Hope you are faring okay with the recent events
How did you end up with Robert Jones on this
Do what you will with this unsolicited opinion but I thought it best if I let you know
Below is the information he requested
Who did it
Mughniyeh was the only one believed to have tried it before
Musawi his wife and children were killed and the revenge attack followed a month later
Mughniyeh waited for his opportunity for revenge
This has worked before but will it now
After a few days of kill 'em all mentality I decided to begin my education in this matter
I do feel more informed
From Colin Powell himself
Al-Qaida - an terrorist organization almost run by bin Laden financially his network is like a holding company
And the HUM focuses their attacks on India
I ask you is the Taliban more responsible than we think
The nations in question will need to eradicate expel extremists from within their own borders
As we know he has invaded Kuwait
We have been funneling our best minds into Technology Banking Law and Medicine for a very long time
I hope the defense around that company is solid

Any way we can do Tuesday
Either Monday or Tuesday works for me

Without your cooperation the business is dead
We need to ensure that we are doing the same
I can guarantee you that your efforts will not go unnoticed
I understand that sharing the margin was discussed as an option
From an external perspective it is imperative that Enron demonstrate its retail capabilities as well as retail earnings
If a portion of retail margin remains in wholesale it does nothing for expanding the stock multiple

As months went by Jim excitedly watched the stock prices and saw it start to dwindle
Who knows what my stock will be worth
John being a good compassionate friend offered to share his last two bottles of beer with his friend

Any thoughts on who we would bump
I cautiously optimistic about UBS
There are no guarantees that we will be profitable
Are you ready for your life to get flipped around
After that it get's easier as you go
So I assume you are riding it out with UBS
Not sure how I feel about the situation
John thought I would drop a line and see how things are going
Unfortunatelty without this cash I really can't afford to lend any
If this deal falls through then I have to find a job with another company
Paying visa bills does help you a bit in this category but not like a mortgage
Hopefully you can get the financing from a bank
Wanted to talk to you about the house stuff
I know it's a lot of cash and I would never want to impose on you
Maybe you can call or email me
