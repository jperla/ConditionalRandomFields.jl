Please email me back with a location for tomorrow's meeting
Also I would really appreciate a schedule of tru= e costs and expected loan

If you have a need for brokers Scott is a good choice
However if the distribution could be made on-cycle I would prefer direct deposit
Have you had a chance to gather the title work
Call or email when you get a chance
However I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares
Cost is a major concern but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs

The call's I am short are way out of the money
I would consider closing those positions
I would like to put the maximum possible into Muni's
Steve and I are inquiring on the email you sent him
When can we reschedule the meeting regarding phantom stock deferral
Unless you close that position you will probably get put those
Shouldn't I buy more than just one or two issues
I looked at the inventory
Phillip Just wanted to give you an idea of what's available
Depending on how much we want to buy we would definitely look at different issues
I turned in the application for a variance yesterday
I was under the impression th= at yesterday was the deadline

If we could work together on this basis I will complete the design selections
However we are leaning towards Kerrville
Thank you for meeting with us today
Feedback Approach We will incorporate the ideas and suggestions you gave us and move forward with this approach
Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating

Unfortunately for both of us a couple of good calls does not a soothsayer make
Too much noise in this market to trade differently for me
By then you should have a comfort level with the quality of my work
If we are at these same price levels in another two weeks that would be extremely bullish
Let me know if this stuff is useful for you
I certainly don't want to waste your time

They haven't used veggie oil yet but are considering it
Russell I think I should give you a little background on small ventures
Bill Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship
As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron
He throws out ideas and every once in a while he comes up with a great one
In return I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within reason
He was absolutely right about the valuation and we on the trading desk knew it as well
Obviously we have this function in our pricing models
Finally on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to Enron
If you believe differently please advise
Can you swap me with Fletch
Try to make all of my interviews as late as possible
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me or John Lavorato

Boys I'm sorry you were not able to attend last night
What design are you talking about
Do I have pink elephants on all my emails or something
But I guess you know that and that's the point
Again I think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very impressive
Just telling people we are innovative made less of an impact
Sorry I ruined your run
At least you weren't molested by the River Oaks car thief
So what did you think
Don't lie or stretch the truth either -- you won't hurt my feelings I promise

Dave I need a favor
I found a good place - Bay Area Sailing
I'm still going to do it
In other words you could rent a sailboat anywhere in the world when you are done
However as fun and as cool as it sounds - it may not be doable
Also got the name of a guy in Keemah that my friends took lessons from a few years ago
So do your plans for tonight involve business or pleasure
Could you change it to NYMEX
Is it possible to reschedule the commercial meeting from Wednesday
Will call your courier on Monday hopefully
There aren't many photos but it sounds nice
And I'll find out from Paula where she made her reservations
It's all up to you now
Errol I did not write up these access trades from Friday
Please make sure they are in
Get email at your own domain with Yahoo
I understand your cost structure is a little higher than Fidelity
I left your key at the concierge desk

Congrats thought you were headed to aig
Counter Party is Transcanada and they are posting with Man South

I still own it
Any decision regarding your return
Thanks and call if you have any questions
If you want to spend it with me would you rather go to the beach or to NYC
Unless you're outdoors in the midst of a cold snap chances are you can't see your breath
Indeed there isn't even unanimity on global warming itself
And not theirs alone
For you it's still free
In the very near future pollution is going to be either a cost to them or an opportunity
There will be a corporate lounge for you to congregate in
I will hold them for you
Hope you had a great time in Cabo

Could you please provide indicative prices as of tonight's close
Debbie If you have availability for either session please sign me up
However we would hold the book getting to see what everyone was doing at all times
Give me a call if you want to discuss
We have managed to double our average daily volumes and are capturing a considerably greater share of the market
One more thing I did not address
We make it a point to never support these if possible
If they don't post numbers on the other systems the systems get no liquidity and die
I don't know whether it is in regards to gas power or metals
David and I found the time especially valuable
We have spotted several issues helpful for our own market
If you cannot please ask your system administrator for assistance
Will this work for you
Will it ever end
We want to control the capacity not own it
Just as the economy is less dependent on heavy industry for its health energy demand is changing
Finally I am London and it is not doom and gloom over here
Obviously most bearish the further out you go
However the game right now is not sell and hold...although it will be soon
What does Greg owe you for the champagne
It is the way California deregulated not deregulation itself that should take the blame they say
But he is sounding a note of skepticism
When this former Carter administration official was pushing deregulation it was still a novel and politically risky concept
Still he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices
But that's not how he wants to be seen
But we didn't make the rules in California
I believe in him and I believe in his policies
CAPTIVE MARKETPLACE That's putting it mildly
Kevin Presto who oversees Enron's East Coast power trades called up the California electricity market on his computer
Suddenly the hurt puppyish expression vanished from Lay's face and a harder more steely look glinted from his eyes
In fact many were at their peak
I used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming deals are after all marketing endeavors
Since then it has suffered a string of setbacks
If you take out things the company might buy anyway like tickets and luxury suites it's small potatoes
You will be automatically notified when they become available
Yes I'm around all week and I don't know why the Tuesday meeting was cancelled
So my point shown a little bit right now.
I think money from here will be made being short just question of what and when
I think it will be spec and hedgers dictating
Are you around next Tuesday
I think you need to check your AGA model
Oh I got it -- you must have had a good date
So tell me about it since I missed it
Good to hear from you
Figured if we got no weather all the customer and generator buying would be my stop

Grab me Thursday afternoon to talk
I asked them to permission on your stack manager this function
Let's hope I don't get shot
I just talked to Henry about another pool session
If you have received this communication in error please contact the sender immediately
I try not to interrupt work with personal business
I completely understand your point of view
The above services provide no value to me personally
However with my natural long I'm not looking to really trade around the position
To that regards I noticed I was not approved to sell naked calls
Please look into that for me
Of course you would then be in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce
Call me if you're interested
Your buddy Beau invited me
If not I need to contact them
I was unable to view the slide show though
Can you either email or mail it to me
Do you talk with him on a regular basis
Should I call

Apparently I missed a little craziness
Not much in it either way though

Can you post a message on EOL to that respect
Greg Somehow I talked Lavo into it
Can you reserve your jet for this Sunday around midnight
Just the more I think about it the worse of an idea it seems for both of us
I still regard you as a good friend
Something I think we both wanted to try and we did
No commercial flights would get us back in time
I was just wondering if your plans had firmed up
Obviously it would be tremendously helpful to me if the plane were leaving after the game

It is unclear how many times if ever Mr Rove recused himself from discussion inside the White House
THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it
The Buddha would have said it maybe had he not been saying the other things
Our enemies can teach us lessons
Our adversaries can make us stronger
They pillage and they profit
Their enemies fall before them like cordwood
And yet we thank them
We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail but we thank them
They have shown us the nature of our enslavement
They have defined the nature of our sloth
We have trusted those who would pander to us
Did we know it was not infinitely renewable
You bet we did
But it was more convenient to forget those things and so we did
We must do the things we must do
The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling and we are patching it up ourselves
AND SOMEHOW EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one we forgot about our own checking accounts
We pay for it
You wonder why they have contempt for us
Because he has
Why did he suggest that
Because he can
Because they can get away with it
They will get away with it
If we understand our foolishness we begin to be wise
We send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind but now we see
And we await developments or create them
Likewise high prices are now laying the seeds of their own destruction
People ditched their economy cars for SUVs

The Power Ministry will now also focus on power distribution he added besides its early preoccupation with generation needs

My bet that this--they had--look they were the market maker
Faber OK so they are not being investigated
Kernen Well I just want to say that the guy is gone now
Cramer Mark you know I'm not on thin ice here I'm not on thin ice
Haines I just want to make sure we understand that this is your theory
Cramer This is my theory
It is my opinion
Cramer We need to find out whether it was orchestrated
Faber Well what they need to do-- Joe they need to come clean
Faber And that would hurt their core business
Kernen That they don't know about at this point
Will it be a liability
About three billion in financing I think is what some analysts estimated
Faber Yeah they can get to most of that with the assets that they have in the partnerships themselves
Kernen I use a six month chart to show what's happened over the last two weeks
But if we went back a year you'd see eighty as far as the high for Enron
Kernen Well I got Dynegy next
Don't-- Here we go
Faber Enthusiastic about your charts
I've worried about the transportation average a lot in my career
Did you see this chart
You going down to En--you going down to Houston yourself
Cramer I may just have to
I may have to clean up that whole city
Cramer No because I think there's a lot of money going into more cyclical issues
I think the economy is showing signs of getting better
The consumer is certainly much stronger than we thought
I don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at this point
I think they are trying to margin us
Do you know what his last name is

Anytime you see a related party transaction an investor should be very careful
Now how does it happen

I am glad to hear things are going well
Do let me have your Hong Kong phone number
On my second year at Lehman I seized the opportunity to do coverage banking i.e
With this step I was fortunate to lead an M&A deal in the consumer goods sector
It also gave me exposure in energy and financial institutions
Thanks to my Enron background I actually showed my value added to Lehman in energy
So far we are both enjoying Hong Kong
Long term though I believe the U.S makes sense for both of us
Hope everything is going well with you
How much size are they interested in
Harry and Brandon Apparently we are not as competitive as we need to be here
My quote to them is at the bottom of the thread

I presume that is required by the courier service in India
Could you share more of the presentation you have
It is very informative about their thought processes and ideas
Greg As you know following the downgrade there is total inability for us to trade
Hope you are doing well
At least that what I do

Michael is the kind of guy you love to hate
I choose to be in a good mood.
Each time something bad happens I can choose to be a victim or...I can choose to learn from it
I choose to learn from it
I choose the positive side of life
When you cut away all the junk every situation is a choice
You choose how you react to situations
You choose how people affect your mood
I reflected on what Michael said
Soon hereafter I left the Tower Industry to start my own business
I saw Michael about six months after the accident
When I asked him how he was he replied
Did you lose consciousness
They kept telling me I was going to be fine
Michael lived thanks to the skill of his doctors but also because of his amazing attitude
After all today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday
Forward it to the people you care about
You know the choice I made
When you move I assume you will probably buy some new furniture.
If you decide to replace the couch will you reserve it for Jason.

I have been trying to contact a new local restaurant near here but their line has been busy
I put some Katy basis products out there for approval
Could you see to those
Have you decided on plans for New Years
Hey we could get a break
Even- if you don't particularly like zoos
I say we hit that Friday morning through early afternoon
I have an appt
I sent you messages from both the boys
Isn't it nice that they independent of each other think of spending New Year's Eve with us
That makes me feel good
But by far the easiest and least expensive I think would be SWCC

Took me two beers to put the flames out
I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain
My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano
FRANK I felt something scraping across my tongue but was unable to taste it
FRANK My ears are ringing and I can no longer focus my eyes
I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics
No one seems inclined to stand behind me except big Sally
I need to sooth my butt with a snow cone
I've lost the sight in one eye and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water
At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me
Screw it I'm not getting any oxygen anyway
Not sure if he's going to make it
By the way tell your boy if he wants something in life he needs to ask nicely
Where did you send this to
I thought you all might find this an interesting read
I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride
Subsequently I called other airlines and confirmed space on flights that would have delivered us to Phoenix on time
Did you have to remind me
That is fine with me
Where are we staying in Telluride again
I do however still have the money that I collected for UT
I would still like to turn the money in

As a sports fan you may be interested in our newest fantasy football game End Zone Attack
Don't Worry about Friday we ended up going out to eat with Michael and Sheila
I don't think that I am interested in the Grace luncheon thanks though
Do you need a check from Shanna for the airfare
If so let me know
What did you do this weekend
I hope we can see you this weekend.
Are you going to Austin
She ought to have a couple of weeks though if she doesn't like what I have.
Messenger - Talk while you surf
I just wanted to confirm my position on the team
I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag football
With these two things in mind I wanted to propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion
If so who should I contact with regards to setting up the tournament
Face it the SEC is having a down year
See you in the Shreveport
After their incredible victory last Saturday night some folks have LSU going to the Cotton Bowl this year
However it would be just as sweet to wip up on our old football nemesis The Aggies
Thought you might like Superfan's comments
There unfortunately overcome by their gullibility syndrome they are apt to actually vote for Gore
Too often we lose sight of life's simple pleasures
So it will have to wait until at least next month

I am really getting worried
Thank you for the card and the flowers
I love you too and I will ALWAYS be here for you
Mail - Free email you can access from anywhere
The rest of you better come too
I know Moni hasn't seen any of you in awhile and she would appreciate all of you being there
Hope to see you all there
My only thought is that it has to be the coaching
Do you think the coaching is one of the problems
Will it ever stop
Either you have it or you don't
It was even his idea
But even in my error I proved my point
I should have stated that Vick is the perfect example
Will he be as big of a threat as Roy Williams
Luis - do you have a friend that can play
Brian - can you ask Lenny to play
Let me know whether or not you will come
Are you up for a little Golden Tee on Friday
How long till he recovers
Are you able to postpone until the ticker system is operable
Horns fans print this off and put on your burnt orange
Someone sent me this a year ago and it still gives me the chills
How is our blocking so different
So here's my question
Is it personnel-based or is it about chemistry
I do like the shotgun
But I agree
In fact they have been the epitome of humility
When he came in as a redshirt freshman he was ready to go
Don't fire a coach before it gets to mid-season
And I would really like to see Nathan Vasher back there
Same old stuff you know
You owe me whatever you want to give
Not much is going on over here just gutting it out until the weekend
It seems like the weeks get longer and longer doesn't it
How are things in your world
You can come by whenever you want to get the check
How much do I owe you again
I was wondering when can I come by to pick up your check for JDF
What did you think of the debate
Yeah I will be there
Are you coming to the game tonight
I think this is one of his favorite bands
I will however not mention another word re election
Do you like the group he's going to see
I'm not familiar with them
Are you going to Austin this weekend
LU-M Hi Mom - I got your e-mail yesterday
Disregard the bills that your recieve from Blockbuster
As a postscript though I bought your Dad a new Marine sweatshirt so you can keep the other one
And I got another bill from Blockbuster for late fees
Perhaps it would be best if you get your own account
Where are you going to work
Hi Mom - I got your e-mail yesterday

Perhaps it would be best if you get your own account.
I think if Applewhite plays and we have a decent running game we can blow them out
What do you think about OU
Please let me know whether or not you will attend
One small feature bothered him however
Totally unable to come up with a reason or explanation he left
Are we done
I know how these things work I've been around the block
Seriously though I will be happy to contribute
I'm sure you all need a tax write-off too right
Thanks in advance for your participation
As many of you may already know I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself
We need team leaders walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal
Thank you very much for your support
I'm sorry but I can't make it tonight
I will be in Chicago
Let me know if you will be able to attend
I don't know if anyone works harder than he does
Against the big boys you better have more balance
But they are happy with Matt Trissel
I enjoy your newsletter
We'll see if he can shake the slump he's in
Keep it up
That's not the greatest criteria in my opinion
I understand that you aren't playing tonight
You don't happen to have your jersey with you do you
As of now we have eight people
Tim - can you see if Micah can play again
Are you going to make tomorrow
Since we all love to read newspapers
I will shop
Alright you know now that you need to trade Taylor - what do you want for him
Do you still want Beasley for Gonzalez
Harry said that he and Matt had tied and now they both have a loss
How come they have a loss instead of a tie
Do you want to go
Can I get the payout for high score today
The Raiders however are a much better team so that should work to our advantage
You can also go through our home page to see it
To us your privacy is a priority
And yes I am a fat ass
Do you want to take Dad somewhere for his birthday
I need your dues by COB today

I'll give you a lift
I almost hit that Aggie fan
Legal Disclaimer This confirmation notice has been transmitted to you by electronic mail for your convenience
I just now saw it
I will look at it when it comes
I ordered one for my mom also
Hopefully it will be as neat as it sounds
I don't know babe
What did you get
I ordered your mom a present yesterday
Is there any others you might remember
I am going to play with Taylor one week
I have been waiting this long
Give me a little time to mull it over
Let me know if I have Anderson or not
Did you mean to trade Bledsoe for Mack
Have you bought any new DVD's recently
Here is the information that you requested
However it includes some players who have been released
Is he too close to the line
And he was right
They were yelling at him to move up
I haven't seen it yet
Please help me understand
Then once his value has maxed out again that's the time to consider trading him
I brought none of the below with me today
Do you have to get a security access
I don't know what he is going to do
What do you think they'll do about the QB situation
I do have to say our QB question has definitely been answered
I just hope our defense can hold up
Is the weekly pot divided or is it winner take all
I would consider a deal for Taylor but I won't give up George
He in my estimation will be starting very soon
What do you want for Taylor
I will make reservations for dinner today
I'll talk to him and get back with you
Are we on our own Saturday
Let me know what time you expect to arrive in Austin
We look foward to spending the weekend with you and Shanna
Come on man- you need help
Pleas let me know whether or not you will attend
I have not received your dues yet
I am giving you a one week reprieve
Something to get you ALL riled up
Please help me
No doubt there are Longhorn scholars who can set me straight
Then I saw things that I cannot really comprehend
Can't keep it up
I do not get it
I assure you I get the sexual nuance - I just do not understand evil
Help me to understand this Longhorn slant on rivalry
I thought we were all against Hitler - Longhorns and Aggies
What don't I know here
What didn't I learn in history class
They prefer to use their middle finger
I just pray they get an honest chance to choose
I am learning
I have attended both schools
I will choose the higher ground
Sister Margaret died and through some error found herself in hell
FACT The geese flying in formation honk from behind to encourage those up front to keep up their speed
LESSON We need to make sure our honking is encouraging
Then they launch out on their own or with another formation to catch up with their flock
Too often the dogs are bred to be vicious at puppy mills he said
I thoroughly enjoyed your visit as well
Hopefully we can make a trip up to Pennsylvania soon
I really enjoyed my visit to Texas
It was great seeing you and meeting Shanna
I hope to see you again maybe next year
Do you know if you are going to make it yet
I have good news and bad news
So we forfeited our first game
The good news is that it was against the Raiders and we probably wouldn't have won anyway
Sorry about the confusion this week but I'll see you on the field next Wednesday night
I appreciate the recognition
Bryan just told me you got promoted to Associate
I want to drop Terry Kirby and Adrian Murrell
Please e-mail me who you want to add and drop
Check you roster to make sure that it is legal
I still need your dues by Sunday or you forfeit
I have only received dues from Dave and Steve
I should have your money to you by Friday
How do I get them to you
Also I have been meaning to talk to you
I am going to pass on the current offer
I want to hold on to Taylor
I don't think Garner will be worth a shit
Now if you would want to do Watters for Robinson straight up I would do that
So if you want to sit we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section
So I think Jason is going to go to the game now
So I need to buy you and Mom tickets
Assuming the weather clears up please let me know whether or not you will make it tonight
Are we done on that trade
Did you see that Taylor is out this weekend
How were you going to get Ricky Watters from your brother
Just put a change request in for me to sign
What kind of show are you running over there
So this is how it will work
It's terrible that you can only visit twice a year
I haven't talked to Dad about details yet
We'll be flexible most of the time but try to work us in around your football schedule o.k.
This rarely manifests itself in blatant partisanship or attacks
So much for their public-spiritedness
We hope Mr Bush sticks with his desire to have a less scripted more open exchange with Mr Gore
Mr Bush has given signs before that he understands his party's media problem better than most other Republicans
To approve this transaction please go to your web site and select Transactions Requests in the Front Office
It will be nice and cozy for the six of us
Maybe we will see you next year
Of course you will have to make it to the Rose Bowl
Do you believe that your RBs suck now
Let me know by today please
Let me know today if you still want to go
Did you get the tickets
How much more $ do I owe you
This is it
I have put several products out for your approval
Thanks for letting us work with you
We will begin testing your index today

I need to get a new gas daily product created
It is your free dinner
Now what we need to know as soon as possible i.e. today so that we can book the air.
Let us hear from you.
What it the abbreviation for our website
I got my little review today
So- I am currently NOT irritated
Here's something you might have already seen but wanted to get it out there anyway
Have you heard anything about the reschedule date
I feel better about my receivers than yours
Would you take Terry Glenn and Charlie Garner for Fred Taylor
Thanks again for all of your help
Say you me and Jason
I suspect that has to do
Thought I would pass it on
Should I collect them up front
I had offered to come and be there during your surgery
You cannot neccessarily associate his actions with mine
I know it has been two months since my surgery.
I don't know why the feelings have finally surfaced.
I did not even say anything to your father until today.
I only saw one.
I was devastated.
Give me a break.
But the most heart wrenching thing is until today you never gave it a second thought
In fact I've gotten it off my chest and this is the end of it.
You reap what you sow.
I guess I was not very good at the sowing part.
I sent that file to you in error
I don't value people by what round they are picked in
This move would maybe help my team the first week but it wouldn't help me in the long run
Listed below is your reservation confirmation
I wonder why everybody wants to do a trade with me
Could it be my team is better than you keep saying
Count me out
I am willing to do a deal for Dillon and Davis
If you can put together a package I am listening
Or if you like Connell better take McCauffrey out
Eric where in the website do I vote on the trade
Whatever do you think I have any control over Ramiro
If you do you are wrong
I don't think he is being ridiculous
Probably more than you have got
What do you want for Fred Taylor
What Do you want for Engram
What is your offer on marcus robinson
Alright I think this is a good deal for you
I don't need no stinkin receivers
That way we have a chance to trade them
If you disagree let me know
What do you want for tony gonzalez
What do you want for Randy Moss
Eric Bass This is your order confirmation please print this page for your records
I have inputted rosters and set schedules
Please check you rosters
Let me know if you are still interested in playing
What night will it be
I just talked to Dad about it
I would like to have cash.
Do you have the RRC historical production data
Have you made an appoinment for the x-rays yet
Did Shanna start her new job yet
How is it going
I don't know
Make me an offer
Are you going to answer my email on the TV
I will do that
How do I go about getting my logon id and password
I seem to have deleted the e-mail that was sent out
That won't work for me when I look it over
I will be at the dinner on Thursday
By popular vote we will not redraw
Might be a little more expensive but probably worth it
Steve Venturatos has graciously offered to take their place
Are you going to convert
Well the closest one I know is the Crescent Court and that is REAL nice and REAL expensive
I am going to see Dad tonight
Where are you going to be that puts you on that side of town
On another note do you know of any hotels in the cotton bowl area in Dallas
Please let me know if I've forgotten anybody
Oh I was thinking of dinner
What would you want for lunch
Let me know about Saturday
If Shanna isn't up for it I'll understand
Sure wish I could help out
We hope you do
How to Pledge This year it is very easy to make your contribution
PLEASE NOTE Your pledge is to be made electronically - it only takes minutes
Your father never listens to me what can I say
But I'm very happy for you
However we still need to decide where and at what time
I would prefer to have the draft around noon
Please let me know ASAP
I suggest we do this the following weekend
Forward this to anyone you think mught be interested
I know you had asked for some info on Texas previously
Sorry it is so late but here is a map of Tx pieplines
I will be happy to help
THis where I need your help
As I understand it his responsibilities are critical up until trading
So late morning and early afternoon might be the best time but you all can work through it
When he sits with Risk he'll probably go home and them return when you all start calcing
I appreciate your support in this but please let me know if you have any concerns
I appreciate your time to help Mike
I couldn't find your phone number in the system
The closer it gets to the end the faster it goes
What makes me think I can
Here is the bbq that I was talking about on Saturday
Let me know if you want to go
Please take some time to Change your team name and logo

Have you registered to vote
Talk to you soon.
Let me know if you can come.
I will pick up more steaks so don't bring your own.
If you can't come I'll freeze them o.k.
I want a recap now bitch
Can you recap all of the draft pick trades
Again I enjoyed the opportunity to meet each of you and learn a bit of what you do
I look forward learning even more
Is it ready to go yet
That's what you need in a quarterback
They'll live it
So what you got
I will try and get back with you today
Give it a rest
Here it is
I want to be there
Let me know when you pick
By unanimous vote we will pre-determine the draft order
Here is the analysis that I completed
I believe Tom is back today and I would anticipate his request for our analysis
It seems as though they are improving however
Hopefully we will be playing for the National Championship next year
When are you coming into town again
Just in case you were interested
Last year we played with a mandatory Tight End
Also I need to know if you would prefer to determine the draft order prior to the draft
Half-awake and nearly paralyzed with fear you hear muffled whispers
With your heart pumping you reach down beside your bed and pick up your shotgun
You rack a shell into the chamber then inch toward the door and open it
In the darkness you make out two shadows
When the intruder brandishes it as if to strike you raise the shotgun and fire
As you pick up the telephone to call police you know you're in trouble
Police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died
Somehow you're portrayed as an eccentric vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choir boys
The national media picks it up then the international media
Your attorney says the thief is preparing to sue you and he'll probably win
After the last break-in you told your neighbor that you would be prepared next time
A few months later you go to trial
The charges haven't been reduced as your lawyer had so confidently predicted
When you take the stand your anger at the injustice of it all works against you
Prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean vengeful man
The judge sentences you to life in prison
Michael Ryan a mentally disturbed man with a Kalashnikov rifle walked down the streets shooting everyone he saw
Martin himself a collector of antiques had seen most of his collection trashed or stolen by burglars
Let me know if this works for you
Let me introduce myself
I have been asked to sit on the Enron Corp
We could use that time to run through your background materials
I look forward to meeting you
After you have completed your third year then you are eligible for promotion to a commercial associate
Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter
I invitate you touch my big beautiful American breasts
I am sure that I have forgotten people so please forward the email on
I hope to see you all
Yep I hit the site every day to check out the weather and snow reports
Have you been skiing before
You're not excited about going are you
Are you hitting that site daily now
Are irrelevant if they contradict your feelings
Let me know suggestions
Can we try another day
Just b/c it wasn't what I was thinking
You are so argumentative- maybe you really should consider law school
I definately feel like I need a vacation
I am not full of shit I will do it
For those of you that can't make it you can draft over the internet
Let me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date i.e
Apparently he thinks I know a lot of noble men here at Enron
If any of you are interested contact John Cote at ext
Spread the word to your colleagues
I am not easily offended.
You would have thought the kid kicked him in the crotch.
So what would you expect - somebody chanting Hare Krishna
If I went to a soccer game in Baghdad I would expect to hear a Muslim prayer.
If I went to a ping pong match in China I would expect to hear someone pray to Buddha
It wouldn't bother me one bit
What about them
Nobody is asking them to be baptized.
Call your lawyer
Our parents and grandparents taught us to pray before eating to pray before we go to sleep.
Our Bible tells us just to pray without ceasing.
God help us
That being said it is time to start thinking about fantasy football again
I was thinking about having the draft in late August
Well maybe it was the color
I bet he thinks I'm a fat hog now
I mean do you think he's met someone else
It pertains to the love note that you left me
Let me know if you can pull this info together
Do you have this information
So I will draw up some plays
Please take a CLOSE LOOK at what's in DRAFT and if you approve I'll put these out
Do you want to come
I thought I was a little cooler than Hector but I guess not
Besides don't throw Brenda choosing between you and Heidi in my face
As a matter of fact I remember giving you advice as a friend on that very subject
I wouldn't have taken it anyway
But I did it well enough to bide time and move on to something that I'm more suited for
Of course you are better at what you do than I
Or I'll send my Dad to beat up your Dad
I hear Tom's on vacation soon
It may not be rocket science but not everyone can hack it
Isn't that why you left the wholesale side of the business
I don't need to talk shit about the game
By the way you can probably see your reflection in that surfboard by now
Bass give it up
They have power hitters they have patient hitters and they can field better than recent versions of the club
Best of all they have a lot of arms and they have Bertman around to use them
Let me know if you can come
Just email me
I will pick up more steaks so don't bring your own
Are we finished
Consider yourselves invited
Christen is buying some beer- but I don't know what type
Let me know of your availability
Then a little cougar hunting at our normal jaunts
Rush El-Amin and Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft regardless of what happens
But if Swift knows he's going to the Clips he could opt to return to school
He has said he will not hire an agent leaving the door open for a return
If they can't trade for Mihm Przybilla is next in line
Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic
None will be available by the time they pick
He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement Rashard Lewis if he re-signs
Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree
Yes we have finally suckered some other Enron group into taking on Bryan Hull
If in haste we have left anyone off our distribution please forward the invite on
If this link does not work copy and paste it directly into your browser
I don't know what your problem is but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce
Is never good for you
I don't work here
I can see your point but I still think you're full of shit
I like you
You remind me of when I was young and stupid
You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers
I have plenty of talent and vision
I just don't give a damn
I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental
Yes I am an agent of Satan but my duties are largely ceremonial
And your crybaby whiny-butt opinion would be...
Do I look like a people person
Off my planet
Does your train of thought have a caboose
I'm trying to imagine you with a personality
How do I set a laser printer to stun
If I throw a stick will you leave
IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team this will be at the same location
If it is raining the practise will be canceled
Let me know whether or not you will be there
Kathy sent this to me
Are you all right
I have included the file for February only
I have made top level adjustments to these deals
Please send me the correct information being careful to list the supervisor's complete name
In addition I am forwarding an e-mail sent by George Weissman to me regarding accrual value
Could you check into this and get back to him
If not how can we find the deals we have held out value to cover these fees
Sorry I didn't call you last night
I'll give you a call later
What real estate school did you got to
To truly love another you must first love yourself
It can provide us with higher highs and lower lows
But if it comes with a persistent burning sensation see your physician
When it becomes a crime to love you should probably consider dating outside the family
If Life hands you lemons today smile and give thanks
Then when Life isn't looking give him a quick knee to the groin
That'll learn him
But giving the finger is free too and I find it more personal and sincere
I really just need historical throughput especially third party to the major market areas
You just have to make sure you don't double dip on gas going through processing plants partnership activity etc
Please let me know whether or not you will be there
Hence the specs sent to Mike that you see in the e-mail below will need to be built
Also can you confirm that you intent to always and ONLY trade this Product during bid week
I owe you a spec
Mark & Michael Remember we had discussed this when you were here

Let me know if either of you would like these passes
I am having a great day - work wise
Are you going to the shell open
Hey sorry I didn't get a chance to call you back

When is it
Do you need me to play
Let me know if you have objections
If you need directions to my apartment or my house in the Woodlands please call
If you could let me know by Friday if you plan on attending and if you are bringing anyone
Please let me know your manager's name
Luckily I managed not to fall and no one was hurt but my wheel was completely bent
I cruised through most of the morning until Bastrop
Once we were out of the park lunch was only a few miles away
I scarfed down some Subway sandwiches and brownies refilled my Camelback and was ready to go again
When you're that close to the finish line you have to suck it up and keep going
It's quite a rush when you get to the end
Thanks again for your support
Just to let you know I'll be coming around next week to collect your pledge
Hope to see you in the race next year
Thought you might be interested in this
Are you excited about the sequel
Don't worry I'll go se it with you
I know you are excite about the reunion so I won't even ask about that
In addition it would be helpful to get a copy of the maps you mentioned below
Please let me know when you can send the maps
What exactly are you using this for
Let me know if you have any further questions
Unfortunately saving the data like you mentioned wouldn't save me that much time
Misti just called asking if we were going
Mom wrote a note to me about your impending surgery
After the first day I saw nothing
If you want to go to the early show we won't be offended
I will follow up with these specific details
I haven't made reservations yet
If you like the idea and you think they can execute then go for it
Hey Eric will you check out this stock and let me know what you think. Good buy
I was wondering if I could get some information on the Costilla deal specifically the repurchase option
I need to know the term locations volume and strike price of the call
How is the world treating you
I need information from each of you
Hope you will but will understand if you do not
Let me know as soon as you can
What do I look like - a key map
Remember that my garage empties onto Andrews
I tried to call you
I need Brandi's Work # Home # and Social Security #
Did you make your reservation
I'll ask them for a timeline
I HAD A MIGRAINE FOR MOST OF FRIDAY AND SATURDAY
NEEDLESS TO SAY I DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THE FESTIVAL

Too good to even talk to me

Everyone just relax because its going to be a long one
Who would have thought it
I hear it was one hell of a party
If you enjoy Politics like I do its a must see event
I hear times are tough for my friends down in Shreveport
Brandon a full time med school student has been moonlighting during his free time
I still haven't found the girl of my dreams but neither has my roommate Matt
Next time you are here have Shana look
I wasn't trying to get you upset
I thought we were having a normal conversation
I think you read too much into me
Besides I'm just trying to find the best way to deal with your attitude
I would feel comfortable looking like an idiot asking u questions
Let me know if not Jay can dedicate some time to it in a couple weeks
If you want we could sit down and go over it to see what needs to be done
Per our conversation these are the meters that I need historical flow information on

If you want the ceiling re-painted I'll do my best
I'm never sure which one of them gets to talk
Right now I guess I'm the guy
Let me back up
I've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life
But I am not afraid
There seem to be new customs new rules new anti-intellectual theories regularly foisted on us from every direction
Let me read a few examples
And why do you continue to tolerate it
Why do you who're supposed to debate ideas surrender to their suppression
Who here thinks your professors can say what they really believe
I don't care what you think about guns
But if you are not shocked at that I am shocked at you
Who will guard the raw material of unfettered ideas if not you
If you see distinctions between the genders it does not make you a sexist
If you think critically about a denomination it does not make you anti-religion
If you accept but don't celebrate homosexuality it does not make you a homophobe
But what can you do
But when told how to think or what to say or how to behave we don't
Disobedience is in our DNA
Disobedience demands that you put yourself at risk
I'm not Complaining but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me
Let me tell you a story
I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly Hills
I owned some shares at the time so I decided to attend
I asked for the floor
I won't read the rest of it to you
But trust me the room was a sea of shocked frozen blanched faces
They hated me for that
Well I won't do to you here what I did to them
Let's just say I left the room in echoing silence
But disobedience means you must be willing to act not just talk
If Dr King were here I think he would agree
I went up to the trading floor this morning
I will be doing half days from now on
I'll let you know when is a good day but it looks like next week might be better
What time can you go
How far is the drive for you
I haven't checked affair yet
Thank you for inquiring about Steamboat vacation information
At Colorado Resort Services Steamboat vacations are our business...our only business

Too bad I don't own any part of the Big E

Just leave me the hell alone
So if you're going to steal the neighbor's newspaper that's the time to do it
Teach him how to fish and he will sit in a boat and drink beer all day
That way when you criticize them you're a mile away and you have their shoes
The amounts above will change as people pay their fees

Also we will be available to assist you as needed after implementation
She wants your body
I left you a msg but here is the info
A guy at work is thinking about upgrading his home speakers

That would be very helpful for my analysis
I have you jacket in my car so let me know what you want to do about that
I hope he is handling it ok
I'm guessing your weekend wasn't very fun
We had a great time at the black swan maybe you can come next time
Let me know when you want to come by
Other than that not too much going on and you
I saw your roommate last night at church
Write back when you get a chance
I promise I won't get AS drunk tonight
After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done
If I start to get nervous I take a sip
At the beginning of the sermon he got nervous and took a drink
Jacob wagered his donkey he did not bet his ass
David slew Goliath he did not kick the shit out of him
The origination of this letter is unknown but it brings good luck to everyone who passes it on
Hope it didn't set you back too much
Then when you create your curves I can just re-map the location to the new curves
Can we set this up for next Tuesday morning
Would you please set this up with them
If possible we would like to meet Mon
Besides I had the last laugh when you had your cosmopolitan last night
What - no response to your ranking yet
Just got your e-mail address
The party will be at my place on Sunday
I will see you then
I will send out another e-mail if I get enough responses
In the middle of their remarks without any &
As soon as they do that hit them again
You don't seem very concerned about me
I would want an average wr and a solid back
I thought I would take all to dinner
Are you interested
I hope you guys can make it
I haven't seen you two in forever
Have a great day and talk to you soon
Not to rub it in but I was wondering if you had tickets you might be looking to sell
Eric I would like to pick up Jason Hanson K on the Lions
I will drop Jaquez Green if necessary
Yeah I actually read that yesterday
Have you ever been to Lawton or Ft Sill OK Knowing that area I understand his view of OK
And no I am not and have never been a patron
You don't have any spare tickets do you
I thought the rest of y'all should read this anyways
I need to pick up a kicker this week
Also do I need to drop a player in order to pick up a kicker
I have a check with me today
How old are you now
Oh well I guess we will see ya tonight
Listen to your Yahoo
Hi Eric I am totally out of cash and have not been able to go get checks cashed
Do you know when you will be here
We look forward to seeing you
I suspect you had a good time
I thought the tee sips looked good
Hard to tell what kind of team Tech has but they did not look good Sat
Hope to se you then
I definitely need to meet some new people
In any event I'm sure that we will run into each other plenty at the gym etc
Talk to you soon Eric
Here is our detail for October
We want you to too
Plus Michael Jordan and the Wizards make their only appearance in December
I 'm the Enron contact for flag football
Where are our seats
Hi Eric Well I wasn't overreacting after all
I just hope it is a permanent credit and not temporary
I believe they will honor it
I think if we had to recover our money from Renaissance it would be difficult
However looks like Eric lost all his money because he wrote us a check which is not covered
Who is his replacement
I like the deal because it give me some instant production but I'm concerned about Bledsoe's injury
I'll shoot you an e-mail over lunch
No but if I here of any unfortunate Sooner fans looking to dump some I'll let you know
I'll bet your able to find some
Nothing too important but if you do receive this and have the chance would you please write me back

As for Enron you are right things will happen for the best
They always do for you Ner
Luckily it seems as though they have all been for the best
I'm glad you responded it is always nice to hear about you and your family
She is very nice and we get along just fine
You know you're stealing money from my severance
If you steal my money you'll have to buy me a beer
I hope you didn't buy any enron
It seems like fate is on their side
Every week we get closer to a Rose Bowl berth
BTW are you still in Hawaii
If you dont like this email then you just don't understand
Again we hoot and holler like wildmen
They are taunting me
I am taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska
He lowers his head in shame
I am KING and these are my subjects
I RULE the pre-game kingdom
Brimming with confidence I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy
I pour another stiffy from the Traveler
I wish I had another Traveler
Surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka
I have not lost faith
The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives
I am beginning to lose faith
This normally would trouble me but I am too drunk to see the football field
I am enraged by this policy
I cheer wildly
I am thirsty
I crack open a beer
I don't care
I am hungry
I go inside the store
I walk past the beer frig
I notice a Zima
I wonder if it's any good
I pull a Zima from the frig
I replace the empty bottle in the frig
I walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub
I eat them
I am still hungry
I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami
The patrons in the store fear me
My truck-mate is tired of my singing
Perhaps he suggests I could just let the CD play on its own
My truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage
I tell him he's an idiot
I tell him we will never get out
He ignores me
I think he's still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes
I am pleased
I am disappointed
Would you mind throwing this away for me
I pretend I'm going to the bathroom but I run away giggling instead
I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me
I sneak into a large group of people and sit down
I am giggling like a little girl
I crack open another can of Bud Light
In my haste to avoid the usher I have lost my bearings
I have no ticket stub
I cannot find my seats
I am enraged
I tell him to fuck off
I'm so drunk I am swaying and grunting
I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye
I look like I should be in an episode of Cops
I take a nap
I see my friend in the driver's seat
I am too tired to punch my friend
I am happy
I return to my vehicle
Sorry can't let you in
We are all asleep with our heads on the table
The waiter wakes us up
We eat every fucking bit of our food
Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted
If you want some whiskey I will buy
As far as the Rose Bowl I think we have a pretty good shot
Of course we have to win on Saturday as well
This has been a wacky year in college football so I think our chances are pretty good
I might be venturing down that path soon
I really know how to pick'em
I don't have your work #
What is it
Do you know who he was and what role he played
Let me know if you guys are interested
When the game is on the line he chokes
Oh well I have to get my licks in while I can
Hello Eric It was great to speak with you this afternoon
Thank you for taking my phone call
This kind of says it all
Hi Eric Would you and Shanna please do me a huge favor on the way over on Saturday
Hi Eric How are you today
Twila said she will probably call you this evening
You have some very thoughtful loving people in your life
Hi Eric Would you and Shanna like to meet us for dinner at McCormick and Schmidts tomorrow night
How are things going with you guys
Can you give me the address of either

I trust everything is going well as Enron
I am actively pursuing a job out here at Mcdonalds
I would like to drop Engram and the Titans defense

Shanna and I always enjoy your company
I understand you are taking Friday off
How many vacation days do you have left
LU-M I got your card
I won't even ask about the mood at Enron today
I will plan something special o.k.
Well I certainly called this one wrong
All you read are the doom and gloom wall street articles
I must now believe they are true
I guess I should just take the lump
On a lighter note talked with Uncle George and he will be delighted to join us for Thanksgiving
Told him I would let him know when we will eat
I just can't believe my eyes
Hi Eric I sure hope all works out for you
When can you pay
Classes are going well but they're keeping me busy as usual
I doubt you see them too often but I thought you'd be interested
Hope things are going well for you
I thought you said he got fired
I forgot honorable is not an Enron admirable trait
Find the one for you at Yahoo
Sounds good to me
I am off work starting next Tuesday so I will probably come out to the house Wednesday afternoon sometime
Do I need to bring anything
Dad do you want to play golf assuming you are up to it of course

Hope you had a good weekend
I played some golf to get ready for you and Bryan
If you are out in Sugar Land you should stop by Monday night or Tuesday before we play golf
I don't think you've ever seen the house
Something we probably all need around Enron
You could even check out the available homes around us
I will be able to make it
This will be an opportunity for us to get to know you and to visit on an informal basis
If you are not the intended recipient you should delete this message
Well the bottom one I think would be best
Hi Eric Sorry but Dad can't make it Thursday night
Dad suggested games etc. and I wanted to bake a birthday cake
It's up to you
I just wanted to make sure you were still in
I think that mine is misstated

As he approached the check-out stand a distant smile caught his eye the new check out girl was beautiful
Later that day after his shift was over he waited by the punch clock to find out her name
She came into the break room smiled softly at him and took her card and punched out then left
He looked at her card BRENDA
Next day he waited outside as she left the supermarket and offered her a ride home
He looked harmless enough and she accepted
When he dropped her off he asked if maybe he could see her again outside of work
She simply said it wasn't possible
Finally Brenda brought him inside to meet her children
Just like her first husband and father of her children did
When her son needed anything Kurtis would take care of him

What do I need to do to rectify the problem
Hi Eric I know you must plan ahead for time off
I keep forgetting that it is sooner than I thought

Frank was excited about his new rifle
So he went bear hunting
He spotted a small brown bear and shot it
There was then a tap on his shoulder and he turned around to see a big black bear
I either maul you to death or we have rough sex
Even though he felt sore for two weeks Frank soon recovered and vowed revenge
There was another tap on his shoulder
This time a huge grizzly bear stood right next to him
Although he survived it would take several months before Frankfinally recovered
He felt sweet revenge but then there was a tap on his shoulder
We have four usernames so play with when you have time
Did you have to bring decoys
Looking forward to hearing from you
Don it was great talking to you about hunting and shooting today
I will let you know how we do
Stop by this afternoon - - I need to talk to you re a personnel issue
Let me know what time works for you
Amigo Good to hear from you
Yeah the pending merger with Dynegy will greatly impact our business
The good thing is that I just signed a two year contract about a month ago
How is your gig
How's everything going for you haven't talk to you in a long time
Are the financial difficulties at Enron effecting you much
I needed that
Feel like shit and Enron is melting down around us
When do you get your Dynegy badge for the front door
How is your woman
If you have any questions please send me an email or call
As you all know our move is scheduled for this weekend
No one will be allowed access withou= t their badge
Thanks so much = for all your help and hard work
I was able to ride on Joe's boat after he got it very nice
I wish I could make it
Happy birthday and drink one for me
It's about time you got your email to work
I called several times this weekend on your cell no reply
I hope your hunting trip went well
Thanks for my birthday supper and present I had a great time
I tried to get a hold of you earlier in the year to no avail
I bought a house in League City
In addition I asked Shannon to marry me but that fell through during the summer
Enron as you have seen in the paper is experiencing some trouble
I heard that you are full on retired
What are you doing these days to keep yourself busy
Hope to hear from you soon
Thank you for your help on this matter
Kim please disregard the fist message I missed a couple of guys
Drop me a line or call if y'all need anything

Or if you are game for Irma's just let me know when you would like to come downtown

Just curious before I send any type of response
I will work on an agenda this week and will send you something later in the week

Your note has made my day
Thanks for taking the time to send it
Your thoughts and support mean a lot to me
We were talking about you last night with Mom and Dad
If I haven't said it recently I am very proud of you
Either way consider it done
However checking the attachment on your second e:mail message I can not bring up the attachment
I will need their e:mail addresses to do so
We will include our recent OU grads as well
Well I didn't get this out to you before I left the office last night
In addition I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you think would be beneficial
And I plan to meet with Fernley as well
I am glad that you asked
I will be happy to bring your things back for you
I will have them delivered to Niki Scott just in case
If you do not get a chance not to worry I'll just have them shipped
It is not on a major street like Picadilly or Park Lane but we like it
We had to move out of our flat on Monday so are staying there until we leave
It is just a pub thing near the office but hopefully you can make it
I am sure there will be dinner or something afterwards
I understand that congratulations are in order for you too
I think that Niki has arranged that for Thursday night
I will look forward to it
I hope that your holidays were wonderful
I plan to be in the London office next week
After a stop by the hotel I should be in the office after lunch
I plan to be there through Thursday and will fly back to Houston on Friday morning
In addition I hope that you may have some time for the two of us to touch base
Also if you have an opening for lunch or dinner do let me know
Also please encourage everyone on your staff to take the time to vote tomorrow
Hopefully we will have all played a part in the outcome
Bruce's rewarding smile made it all worthwhile
It's a whole new life for me
I will contact both and get info
Then we should make reservations soon
I'll call Cindy tonight and fill her in
I love it
I think that is perfect
Much easier for my family and probably for everyone else
That way we can probably do this on their anniversary assuming that works for everyone
Therefore going forward we will need to put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file
Thanks so much for your help
I knew that you would still be in London
Yes I will be in London next week
I will be there through Thursday and will plan to fly back to Houston on Friday

One of those might catch their interest as well
If you are available on Monday your input would expedite the review and revision process tremendously
I will ask Patti to schedule a meeting
Thanks for passing it along however
They renewed their request for Enron's participation
What is your view on this
My recommendation is to forget it
Have you discussed Enron's participation in the project with your colleagues
Give me a call and we will set something up
I will be back in the office on Thursday afternoon
You should find that when you return to the office
Let me know if for some reason you do not have that copy and I will have another delivered

I have completed internal feedback forms through the PEP system for Brent Price Bob Hall and Peggy Hedstrom
If there was intent for me to respond to any others they weren't accessible in the system

Thanks to my sister Sally I have a decent maternity wardrobe to carry me through several more months
Would you advise working up till the date

Although Shawn made an offer to Michelle some time ago there was a long lead time for her arrival
Great to hear from you
I was thinking about you today
I do need a break
I will be working the week after Christmas
Lots of my logistics and risk guys will be in so I will probably make an appearance that day
Hope that you Frank and Lauren have a wonderful Christmas holiday
Alternatively we could get together then
I am really looking forward to learning something new and working with you
If we don't speak before the holidays I hope your family has a wonderful Christmas
They asked that we not communicate results until after that date
Hope that you enjoy the holidays

I love you
I appreciate the time and help you have all provided

Mo will be in Houston while you are here
We could call MG Shetty and with you and Mo and me it would be quite a reunion
I want to make sure EBS is consistent
I remembered that you will be coming in from London
Sunday evening will not be lengthy as I am sure that you will be tired
We will see you on Monday
Thanks for you help and attention to these problems
Do you know these folks
They should be visibly on your floors
Let me know if that doesn't happen
I will be going to the doctor's appointment with my dad
I have asked Shona Wilson to attend in my place
Please continue with the meeting as I know that this is a difficult meeting to schedule

Attached for your reference is the agenda

Bill Bradford will join us for dinner and we are waiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy
Before lunch Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic
Please call me or e:mail any comments or suggestions
I will be going with him to the appointment
I gather that they are still using spreadsheets which in and of itself is not necessarily a problem
Are their positions not being captured and aggregated
I will not opine on such matters
Since this was a fix to a Doorstep finding how do we react
When their volumes increase we can address the Enpower implementation again
Are you OK with us moving on this
Based on this I want to set South America up on their own instance
I will see you there
Is it still OK on your calendar
That date does not work for me now
I need to attend a get together for the CommodityLogic team that evening that was just set up today
This is in addition to my role within ENA

Are his concerns in the memo accurate
Thanks again for all your help and hard work
Sally Thank you for forwarding this information to me
Actually for OU students I will be calling them personally tomorrow to let them know their status

Can you let me know what time works best for you
Please let me know your preference
If you will be doing it please respond with your earliest availability to conduct that meeting
Thanks for providing your resumes
I will feel more informed during the process

I will let you know what I hear back from him
Keep me posted on details
I do not yet have a rescheduled date
I will let you know when I do
Thanks for your attention to this
I don't think that John Jacobsen should be reviewed in London
Pulp & paper is still an ENA group even though we have John reporting to you
We did review him in our PRC
Does this make sense to you
I really think this should be no greater than one page
I hope that your holiday was wonderful
Nikki told me that you would be working from home today but I decided not to bother you there
Will you still plan to come to Houston next week
I have scheduled dinner for us on Wednesday evening assuming that you will still make the trip

If it is okay to release this information to Lisa please forward to Norma with your approval
For a woman who can't remember the last time that she cooked dinner this will come in very handy
Thanks too for the beautiful flower arrangement that has graced my desk for the past two days
I have this on my calendar and I will be there
Glad you could make it yesterday
I will keep your number handy
Sally I really appreciate being able to play on your behalf in the tournament yesterday
It's always nice to interact with your peers outside of work
However given my immediate project I don't think that I could have called until now
I am still really crunched tomorrow morning
If I miss you then it will be late afternoon Houston time before I could call you
I am definitely very interested in continuing our conversations
So I will either catch you from my car tomorrow morning or we can talk on Monday
This looks like it could conflict
Please let me or Sheila know
If you can stay at the hotel this team building will probably be enhanced
I talked with her quite a bit before the presentation and was impressed with her
Nor am I really caught up on e:mail messages
I did find one that I have not used
Attached is your actual form
He will be moving to Columbus Ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire
Jeff I spoke with Todd Burke regarding a retention strategy for the managers we talked about
I will forward any updates as they become available
Thanks for asking me

Thanks for the note and thanks too for taking time on both days to talk with us
As you continue to consider applicants for positions I hope you will keep me in mind.
I am confident I can be an asset to your company.
I want to thank you for interviewing with me last Thursday
You made the interview more relaxing and I enjoyed our conversation

Sounds as if you should see a white Christmas
I can just picture her shopping
We will look forward to seeing you for lunch on Saturday
Hi Sally--am sure you are glad to be back from cold dark cruel Oklahoma
Looking forward to seeing you all on Saturday
Hope you don't mind my extending that invitation
I think we would benefit from attending
Thanks for looking into this for me
Patti has his home number if you need that
Effective tomorrow Jeff Gossett will assume leadership of the gas risk group reporting to me
Please join me in congratulating Jeff on his new responsibilities
FYI...I will keep you posted
I agree that we must do something quickly to resolve this
Please keep me up informed on this matter
I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley with no resolution
Please let me know how this can be resolved
I want to send the official invitation early next week

Let me know what you hear from Mo -- it would be wonderful to see her too
It has been so long since we have talked to her

I have seen Beth Apollo at two meetings in Texas recently one in Dallas and one in San Antonio
They will be staying with us at our house
She is an older woman but I am sure that they do well
It would be fun for all of us to get together
I may need to head to London in October or November
I will let you know if my travel plans develop
How was it
I will be anxious to hear
Thanks for sharing this with me
Since you asked for input I hope that you don't mind that I gave you some
Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note
I am laughing outloud
To be sure it is the highest quality pour one level cup and drink
Now shift the lemon juice and strain your nuts
Whatever you can find
Are we working on this
I didn't know the approval would go to you otherwise I would have prompted you for the approval
I thank you in advance for your cooperation in this matter
The status will display Closed when your request is complete
Fernley I think that you are right about easy access to the standards
However I thought that I would let you know so that we would not duplicate any efforts
My concern would be access to details of the standards themselves
For your consideration
FYI - yes my response was lengthy
This employee and his supervisor Bob Schorr do not report in to me
Your schedule makes me tired
I hope that make it over the week before Christmas
The week is kind of crazy for us so I am trying to find a time that will work
It will be multi-generational - I hope fun as it would be a nice tradition to continue
On Monday I think that David plans to take Tyler and Amanda to Longview for a visit
Wednesday we have matinee tickets to see A Christmas Carol at the Alley Theater sans Tyler
I am so glad that he is doing better
I hear you about Mom
I think that a blow-up or some drama is highly predictable unfortunately
She seems to do that a lot at special occassions for Cara doesn't she
I will certainly help in any way I can
And I will be very interested in the gosipy details
Good thing since I have volunteered to be Martha Stewart at many school events this week and next
I am totally ok with us not doing the shower
At work we start on a contract for Dell in January
Well she declined our kind offer didn't she
Hope you all are doing fine
Thanks for your list
Thanks for looking into the OU/Texas tickets for us
With the ages of the kids I think that we will pass on those single tickets
The kids love our home tradition for the game and weren't sure that they wanted to give that up
Last year we played right up to Thanksgiving in the playoffs
It was good to see you in Norman earlier this week
As always I appreciated your attendance at the presentation and at Coach's afterwards
I should be able to get back with you next week hopefully with a change in our strategy
If you do become aware of five OU /Texas tickets please let me know
We will certainly purchase them I just made the assumption that all tickets may already be sold
On another note David has worn his OU shirt to work and has gotten lots of compliments
He has a number of people that have asked him about school shirts caps etc
If you have not received your invitation please let me know
Please put this on my calendar
As always we welcome your questions and will answer any questions submitted in advance
Of course we also welcome and will answer any questions raised at the meeting
We look forward to seeing you there
Yes he is working on the short list
I do have to say however that I have not had questions from him on any of those names
I will leave him a voice mail message for an update
I have begun initial interviews this week
I hope to get to your group the week after next
However I will be calling next week to set up interviews with both you and your Directors
Please call me if you have any questions
I look forward to meeting you and your group
They met with my direct reports
However we have to reconvene as we ran out of time to cover all issues
Are you aware of the problems with SAP
Russell - as I remember Willie finaled the Supply Verification and it was interfaced to SAP
If you have any further questions about this call me
Did Willie not do his job
I need that for her itinerary
It's just makes it easier for me
As you know exceeding this limit would require contacting the Enron Board of Directors
Obviously we want to meet Skilling's request with information that is as timely accurate and complete as possible
I updated that systems matrix recently in preparation for our much rescheduled meeting with AA on risk controls
I have been publishing an ENA operations report monthly since June
With the recent reorganization I am working with EGM and EIM to create the same report
Also how are we coming on an operational position report
Let me know your questions and comments
Thanks for calling in list to me yesterday
Unfortunately her schedule will not allow her to be out on Thursday
I have attached the Itinerary along with details regarding the event
I have attached the strategy also for your review
Please don't hesitate to call me with questions
Here's info you requested
Please have person contact me directly as I keep Sally's calendar
She will be in training all day Thursday & Friday so Monday would be the soonest she is available
This employee and his/her manager Bob Schorr do not report in to me
Please let me know your plans
Too late with your spreadsheet
We got those to Rick today by noon as he was leaving the office
I hope that you will take these suggestions in that light
I do not know the employee and without the name of the manager I can't possibly approve this
Did you intend this to go to Sally Beck - VP Energy Operations
I think you may have the wrong Sally Beck again
Might want to check your address list for future distributions
I know that recruiting events can be a drain on staffing but it is also time well spent
I just wanted you to take a look at this
I apologize if this causes any inconveniences
I met with Todd recently
Mary may have one of her directors host the student
We want to ensure that you are still able to participate
When you have a moment please advise
A successful Job Shadowing program requires your department's commitment and participation
If enough departments participate it is possible that each department may only be needed on a quarterly basis
Please advise if anyone in your department is interested in assisting
I will be helping to facilitate their meetings
If you do have an interest please let me know which times are most convenient in order of preference
The presentation and your comments were direct and concise
Thanks for your dedication and enthusiasm on this project
I was out of town last week doing some recruiting so I am just reading your e:mail today
Thanks for your assistance
This came in while I was in Austin last week so I am just reading it today
So if you can make one of the other two dates work I would love to come
Just keep me posted
However I would LOVE for you to come to the one shower - if it's convenient for you
I would love for you to meet my friends and for them to meet you
But if you'd like to consider coming I'd like to know your schedule
We're talking about a weekend lunch or afternoon thing I think
We will need this so I am sending it to you as well
Seems like they may have the wrong person
Can you follow up
If you have any questions please give me a call
Thanks for your prompt response
Thanks for you message
I am planning a trip to Chicago soon so I will look forward to seeing you there
It was good to see you last week too
That was a big group and there were many people that I just passed in the halls
Thanks for your consideration to participate in this effort
Proposed agenda We would like to interview managers and their administrators
To do that we need your help
Who do we want to interview and observe
In a one-day visit we want to observe and interview three types of managers
What can you expect during a site visit
This allows our team to introduce themselves and explain their objectives
We ask people to be completely honest and forthcoming with us
It was nice to meet you last week
As we discussed I recently moved into the Customer Service Solution Manager role within the ISC
In case I can not make the meeting I have printed the attachment
I look forward to receiving your feedback
I have confirmed your attendance with your assistant
Please notify me if you are unable to attend
David told me that he ran into you at lunch
How are things going for you
I hope that this was a good move for you
If you have any questions please feel free to contact me
Please print all attachments for me
Hope you find it useful
Please come back to me if you need any more info
I was able to get into the application this time
So I do not know if this worked
If you can forward contract to me I will see that she signs it asap
Will she be available to sign
I believe that Beth is out sick at the present
I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned
Even at a stand still my team had great concern over the rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy
She did get put into a routine last year as an alternate but you never know
I am headed to Dallas early tomorrow morning
Patti has sent you a copy of my itinerary
Please give me your input
Great idea -- hopefully we can make that happen
I sent you a newspaper article in the mail today that you may get before you leave
Hey Sal - just got your itinerary from Patty
Therefore Rick has asked that I attend
In my absence please contact the following persons in Houston with questions
Unfortunately she developed complications during the last two weeks which resulted in her being removed from the transplant list
Several of us will be attending the funeral today
Have you had a chance to talk with Dave B on any of this
Nothing may come up but I think that Tom would feel better with this gesture
Do you have contact information for Brenda
If not I would get that from Yvette Convey her assistant
I have also been involved with the Entex contract valuation
I think Structuring will really be helpful in this arena
After our meeting yesterday I believe everyone is much more comfortable in our approach
I do not want anything falling through the cracks
I have asked Lexi to update me on the meeting
Please come and meet your fellow team members
Let me know what I miss in the meeting
I will be at the presentation
Thanks for letting us know about Blake
Wow - thanks for copying me on these
She thinks she Chris and baby will go
Shall we give her that reality check now or later
After you have received all responses I will be curious as to the number and nature of changes suggested
I will reserve judgement on that however pending your assessment once you have gotten all responses
I can be reached at ext
As I discussed in the staff meeting I am sending you the global standards for your review and comment
Lastly in the upcoming month we will start to implement exception reporting for these standards
Not too mountainous but I am sure that would be fun
Hopefully we could arrange something like that
Should we pin them down on an exact location maybe have them pick two or three and rank them
And what do you and Cara envision -- a weekend a few days a week
Please return this to me for my approval when complete
FYI - I responded to Sharron
RSVP Yes I will attend
In cleaning up e:mails I can across this one from Sheila
In recent years it has been held in San Antonio
I have done a quick review and I agree with your thought processes
I will be in a PRC meeting
Try me next time
Thank you in advance
Do you know who this is
I don't recognize the manager's name
I will look forward to seeing you there
Will you be in Dallas next week for the ASE
I look forward to seeing you there too
On Sunday the new Fortune magazine was a roadway for my two-year old's cars
On Monday my sixteen year-old used the cover to cut out pictures of money for a school project
I smiled while reading it
How nice to see your accomplishments recognized in print
Glad you got some rain
I am also going to invite my cousins Fab and Mary Anne
I thought that this was going to be corrected last week
I understand that there are bugs in the system
I tried to reach you by phone
I look forward to hearing from you on solutions and timing
If you will not be able to attend please r.s.v.p your regrets
Just a little more slowly than I would like
Please let me know if you need any help
I met with Karen Marshall today
I don't immediately recognize her name but wonder if that's who this is
I am sure that Jeff has communicated this to you
Sally FYI Lisa Peterson turned in her voluntary resignation today and it is effective today by her own choice
We have her resignation letter on file
Check with Karen to see if she is handling hotel reservations or if we should make those
Please print this memo and attachments in color for me
Specialist would not require additional approval except your own
Please let me know if these look like the final ones
This was sent for my approval
If you absolutely can not find enough of the right players to go on the cruise let me know
With this in mind I am hoping that you will make yourself available to participate in this event
I will then give you the logistics for the event
And in June I think that the mountains sound great
We stayed at a place that was supposed to be terrific but we did not care for it
I did some pushing for the anniversary decision
Large number but still percentage-wise smaller than we would like
If you have not yet completed your electronic pledge please consider doing so as soon as possible
Please print the attachment below for me in color
I don't think that we are purposefully doing duplicate work
I believe that these are pretty manual as there are no systematic feeds from Entelligence into GCP
Your input will help me with that
As a PRC rep I have been assigned the Associates to represent in the meeting as indicated below
I have this on my calendar
At this point I do not plan to bring anyone else to the meeting
Sorry that I missed you this morning
I want him to think like a consultant on these projects not as the contracted hired help
I don't know about the one month timeframe
I don't think that Todd is keen on any elongated stays in Europe particularly without the family
Can we still use Todd
Thanks again for all your support
I worked with Mike on the language for this paragraph
I'm glad to know that she is home
Can you join me at this meeting
Then it's on your calendar after that
I think that I saw yours
Did I miss you sometime this weekend
With almost two teenagers in the house my personal messages have dropped very far down the list in importance
Feel free to call me at work or I can try to catch you during my commute tonight again
Keep me posted on what you hear
No I didn't get the message that Cara had called
With almost two teenagers in the house my personal messages fall very far down the list in importance
Did you get the message the Cara called you yesterday
Please RSVP to me as soon as possible
I will have three persons leading the natural gas team Steve Jackson Leslie Reeves and Bob Hall
I am confident that this will work well
FYI Rick agreed with the attached note that I sent him
By voice mail I suggested Ted Murphy as a substitute for Rick Buy for the meeting
What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert
I have checked Mark's travel schedule
Can you provide more details beyond your presentation
What is your background and experience
Can you provide information on your company
Thanks for your consideration
If you look at his resume is already with Enron as an Associate
Normally I think that associates talk directly with someone in a group in which they may have an interest
I am not sure how I got into this loop
Sally I think this one is for you
Please do with it as you see fit
There I honed my analytical skills commercial knowledge and cross-functional team experience through financial modeling and risk assessment
I have attached my resume which details my accomplishments
I will definitely look into that for Meagan
I wish that we could meet for lunch
But she did make the dances for the next two try-outs a kick rountine and a pom routine
Hopefully she will make both
I think that she would feel pretty good about that
That was always one of my favorites
The old Parent Trap is always great too I wish that I could be there
I know that Brigeda must be excited about the slumber party
When does she start school
Despite annual struggles with algebra and geometry she signed up for both Physics and Pre-Calc
I don't know what she was thinking
Hope that you have a good weekend
I would assume that with his supervisor listed as Ed Baughman that he is in a commercial origination group
Thanks for copying me on this
It is interesting to see your thoughts
So sign-up but don't rely on anything until we see everything working
Does it mean we hold off doing anything
What else did you come up with
Do we have these numbers for Hector
Sally You may find a need to contact me at off hours in the future
Here's how you may reach me
PS I'm still trying to rig my voice mail to automatic pager
I don't know Mog Hue
I don't know Sabrina Rank
Yes Tammy is still with us
I truly am blessed
Do you still have Tammy watching the kids
I'm sure you feel so blessed -- you are
I know that sets some kind of record at Enron
What a delight he continues to be
I know that Erin has worked hard
I hope that she and her husband are doing well
I acted impulsively when I saw you this a.m
I apologize if I disrupted you
I hope your family is doing fine
Can you arrange with Bobbi
Can you clarify this for me
I have completed preliminary rankings on the attached sheet
You had included my name and I did not put in a preliminary rank
I would put him in the Excellent category at this time
Please pass the kudos along to the rest of your team
I especially enjoyed the breakfast at Depelchin last Friday
Although we have done much we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA and Energy Operations this year
To help in this effort I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J
Of course given the size of our group it will not be possible to meet with each of you
Can you help me on this
Makes it tough on someone to act on these especially when sent with a name
I can't shed any light on the topic choice
Surely you can redirect the topic
Both the students and I are looking forward to your presentation
In advance of the presentation could you provide me with a brief biography for introduction purposes
When Sally goes to website & enters her ID & password steve.beck comes up - not sally.beck
Until this is fixed she will be unable to process these requests
If you have not already done so I would encourage you to complete your pledges before Tuesday
Also do you have a direct report meeting on a regular basis
If I don't get a chance to reach you today I will call during my commute tomorrow
The case will continue on Wednesday so our scheduled time for a conference call may not work
I will be available to take messages also
I left you a return voice mail regarding Scott
I hope that Jo likes Dr Moore
Is this supposed to be her title
Thanks for your earlier phone message Leola
If you charged ENA at the time of enrollment please reverse that charge
It is the r elativity of his performance that is key not necessarily the label of that category
Sheila I want to update you on Steve Schwarz' status
Keep me posted
Sally Gary wants me in NY tomorrow and the rest of the week
Did you still need to ask me something
I just wanted to follow up with you
Did you mean to send that e:mail to me
It was Greek to me and I assume that the Sally it was meant for was that Sally Conover
Feels like a Monday doesn't it
To my surprise I was chosen today to sit on a jury to hear a felony charge
I am currently working to reserve a room at Ninfa's
Is either day better for you
If you'd like to see the logo the team selected you can go to luminant.com
I will be working in Chicago Monday and Tuesday next week
Todd tells me that a logo has been selected
Can you e:mail that to me
If not available electronically I will see it when I am back in the office next Wednesday
My assistant Patti Thompson will have hotel phone numbers where I can be reached as well
Patti has contact numbers for me at both offices
Enjoy it without me
Please RSVP to me if you will be able to attend
Should this date not accommodate your schedules we will endeavor to find another suitable alternative
I put in on Sally's calendar
As you recall we have been down the road of improving the service to Calgary previously
At that time we had one attorney who did not have expertise in the financial area
As you saw from my memo confirmations are periodically sent out without our review
The first two issues cause me a lot of concern
Some of the confirmations sent out without our review were wrong which is a big problem
So we are both printing and reviewing the transactions following up with the counterparties and filing these documents
As I stated before Calgary could assume full responsibility for the financial confirmations without adding any staff
Because we review the confirmations the basic understanding of the financial transactions already exists
As a final note I report to you
If you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in this memo please let me know
Please let me know how your meeting with Mark goes
We will keep you posted on both items
On more than one occasion confirmations have been sent to our counterparties prior to review by Calgary
We have been assured over and over that this will not happen again however it continues to happen
Luckily this confirmation went out without any errors in it
As far as I can tell we simply screwed up on this deal
Call me if you want to discuss
If you have any questions I can be contacted at ext
Sounds like fun and you are definitely planning ahead
Please insure that my hotel reservation is for a non-smoking room
Open the attachment to view your travel itinerary to the Enron Executive Management Conference in Las Vegas Nevada
Please reply and advise if these flight times meet your schedule
How do we get the right focus on support for Calgary
Every screw up looks big to them and they can't understand how mistakes continue to happen
She can fill you in on the details in that situation
Susan Do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with Calgary
If you would like to discuss the possibilities I would appreciate the opportunity to visit with you
Please call or respond via e-mail at your convenience
Thanks for including me
Enjoy your new role as mom -- it is a wonderful life-long experience
Please RSVP to me by email or phone
This is my first day back from vacation
Per Sally's instructions - I am forwarding this document to you
Tyler has school on Tuesdays and Thursdays but my nanny is at home with him on the other days
Would it help for her to take Albert
Thanks for your concern I'll keep you posted
I thought that the course was very good
I will look forward to hopefully seeing all of you there
Just a reminder for Monday to get this for me
Too bad they didn't deliver these
Hello my name is Gwendolyn Gray
I am in the Associate/Analysts Human Resources Department
Please remind him of that
I plan to get with him
Mom and Dad hope that you have fun if you are going on your trip
Just a reminder about my being on vacation next week
As mentioned I will be out on vacation next week
I have it on the calendar
Mike McConnell and his wife plan to join us
If you are in Houston I hope that you will be able to join us too
Wanted to get the date on your calendar however
Let me know if you will be in town
Would like for both of you to join us if possible
I will bringing Brenda Peters who is with OU Career Services down with me
If you would like to suggest a time and place to meet please feel free to do so
I will be in Houston that entire week making my rounds
Please send this wherever it should go
Attached is your expense report
Please let me know if any revisions are required
If no revisions are necessary please forward to Sally for her approval
I do not have a pager
Are these still your correct #'s
Thank you for your response
What do these changes do to you
I thought that I would provide you a copy as well
Motivational I hope
At that time we will schedule a photographer for both of you for the end of July
If not just let me know
I'm glad that you made the decision to come here
Hopefully that decision will feel right to you in a very short period of time
They both report to me
They can help you on any details about our power business
Stop by if you get the chance
Today is my first day here in Dana's group
I am not sure that I have a high-resolution photo
So we probably do need to schedule a photographer
I will be in the office next week Wednesday through Friday
Let me know when the photographer will come so that I will know what to wear
Thank you for your revisions
Yes we do need a photo of you for your article
Do you have a current high-resolution photo slide or negative that we could borrow
I know that you will be going to Florida soon
Thanks again for your timely return of the article
If so how does she access
I have listed your assignments for the summer below
In addition please review your school schedule with each supervisor
Overall these pipelines worked well with us today
So I will invite all to bring a spouse/guest
If so this might be a good event in which to include them as well
Sorry that I keep missing your calls
I will be meeting with Fernley but I will also try to reach you by phone tomorrow
She really needs your input in order to properly represent Cheryl
I will work on further details
I look forward to catching up then
Many of you may have met Mike a fellow OU grad
Two other Enron employees will join us for lunch
James will be helping us with our OU recruiting efforts
I want to send her some flowers at the house
Will keep you posted
FYI - This came as a surprise to me
Didn't know whether or not you knew about GInger's departure
I have an outstanding opportunity to head up Reliant's MBA Program
I have enjoyed working with all of you
I am happy for you but know that Enron will be losing as you leave
It has been fun to work with you Ginger and I too will miss that
Best of luck to you
I know that Amanda will enjoy seeing you next week
Thanks for making some time for her
Thanks for your message the other night
I like the idea of riding around in the cart
Looks as if this date will work for Mike McConnell and his wife too
Do you have an e:mail address for him
I think it would be a good idea to include friends/dates
Let me know of anything else I can do
Thanks for your front-end research on this
Sounds as if they are inflexible as well
How does this fit with your group
When would be a good time for you
We will take considerably more time as we review the managers who will have been pre-ranked as well
I do not know yet if she will attend
Can I ask what are the plans
I will take you up on it
I have the list of summer interns from OU
How does that date work for you
I assume that summer interns will still be with us then
What is your opinion on dates/friends to accompany you
Do you think that people would prefer to bring someone along or simply attend solo
I will take your suggestion on this one
Please let me help with any of the logistics set-up and clean up
I know these things require a great deal of effort especially when you welcome people to your personal residence
I want to and insist on helping in whatever way I can
If possible we might schedule a lunch to discuss the specifics
I would also be grateful if we could discuss my most recent opportunity at Enron Texas Risk
He won't change the world but he is diligent about getting a prescribed job done
His wife has MS in its most severe stages
I suggested that Brent would be better able to address that
I assume that Danny is following up with Brent
Danny suggested him
I here he has some 'issues'
Thanks in advance to your attention to this
They all made me laugh out loud
I am glad that they all were able to get up
I thought my sisters might appreciate these
Thank you for contacting me first before going to Bob
Patti has lunch and snacks ordered so I would hope to be finished sometime in the afternoon
I would include Global Products as well
I will not attend the Friday afternoon meeting
She will need a compilation of your accomplishments by Thursday
If you have directors reporting to you please request that they also have data in to Sally by Thursday
I would love to visit with you
Once you have scheduled a trip my offer still stands to set up these meetings for you
I will look forward to speaking with you
I understand that your value in the office is already felt
Do you have anytime today / tomorrow
I will e:mail you tomorrow
Thanks for the info on your trip
I meant to send this to you
Glad we could work out a date
Glad it still works for you
We'll look forward to seeing you guys and the new digs
Do you want me to set up a conference call with you Scott Earnest and myself to discuss
Let me know what I need to do on this
I will assume that is in addition to gas but I don't know that for sure
Have you had any conversations with Jeff on this
I interviewed Analyst/Associate candidates in the office on Saturday as did four other directors/senior directors from Energy Operations
Let me know about next steps in this process
I got the memo from Naomi that you sent
Does he have a strong background in trading operations
From the sound of Naomi's memo it looks as if Andy Cornfield is assume to have the US responsibility
Again I don't know Andy
I have also mentioned Shona as a good resource as well
Separately I didn't get time to speak with you individually when I was in Calgary the last time
I'd love to do lunch when you have the time
It will help me in serving Energy Ops
I apologize if I seemed impatient in the meeting
I will have Patti get a date on the calendar
I didn't know that you were talking to Jennifer
What is she going to do for you in gas
So I obviously will get Scott Mills in return
I didn't know about this one
On another note I enjoyed lunch today
Please pring attached presentation for me in color
Can you verify that Sheila received those from me
We got our first letter from Amanda yesterday and it sounds as if she is having fun
Said that she was homesick and missed us but was not sad
As we discussed she will have a continuation of her birthday when she gets back home next weekend
I have written her several times
Give that Tyler a big hug for us
I get hundreds of these many for employees outside Energy Operations
Please print for me on legal size paper
If you have any questions please let us know
Her name is Shona Wilson and I do not know her extension
I will have her contact you later today
Can I talk to the person sometime today or tomorrow?
Please provide me with the name and tel no
Sally's employee starts on Monday I will let you know who she is and arrange a call
It was nice talking to you on the conference call
Have you had a chance to review my presentation?
Your comments would be extremely helpful to me
Do you plan to travel to India in the near future
Here is her response
Or is he working on some other initiative
Clients are extremely impressed with his knowledge and background
I would highly recommend him for a leadership role at Enron
He works with my husband
I know him on a personal basis
In the past she worked in the Texaco internal audit department
Before that she was an audit manager at AA
I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very conscientious
I do not know if she is looking or not but its worth a try
I know him on a person basis but have not worked with him
I don't have his phone number but should be reachable through the general number for Koch
We are following up on her leads for talent
How soon do you start
Thank you for your recommendation
I assume that more details will follow
Thank you for your help and participation this season
I hope everyone enjoyed a safe and pleasant Thanksgiving break
Secondly please make a point of seeking out these interns and welcoming them to Enron
I welcome ideas on this from any of you
For those of you who couldn't attend the information will be delivered to you via inter-office mail
As we discussed yesterday our goal is to ensure a quality summer for all of our interns
Thank you again for your time and your support
Please contact me if you have any questions
I will be out on vacation on Monday
I will check with Ted Murphy on the Tuesday Risk Forum meeting as occassionally the meeting is cancelled
Do you have any available time in these three days
Sounds as if you will have a full day on Monday
Enjoy your next few days
I hope that orientation is helpful on Monday
I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday
You have left Brent Price off of the list a VP who reports to me
Is Rick Causey planning to pre-rank Brent or does he want me to handle that
Do your records not show that Brent reports to me
I approved his reviewers in the PEP system
We may have discussed this already but I think I have forgotten the answer sorry
I have some urgent bills to pay and need an RC
By the way are you coming to London
It will be great to have you back here in Houston
Please let me know if you can't make this new time
Can you attach file
I talk with Brent Price several times a week
I will call in and let Patti know my status
Congratulations on your added role of Chairman and CEO of ENA
I look forward to working with you when you arrive
Congratulations on your new role as Chief Strategy Officer
However I hope that we will have opportunities to work together in the future
Thanks again for meeting with my expanded staff yesterday
I hope that all of you enjoy the evening
Wanted to keep you posted on this
Sandra I learned that this morning
Thank you Sandra
I'll make sure Jeff sees it again as soon as possible
It was nice to meet you
You and I can discuss those if you would like
Kristen was going to meet with you
Let me know if you hear anything
Let me know when you want to talk dates
Yes I hope things start getting better for M & D I do want to come for a visit
We will do that so you and I can talk dates
Please print the attachment for me in color
When can you meet up
Is there any other info that you need
Are you still planning to be in Houston next week
I suggest that we involve Scott in these discussions
You have the right earrings -- they are tiny
But that's what she would like
Sounds as if your weekend was fun
Otherwise just camping out in the mess at our house
I did talk with Mom on Saturday night about a psychologist vs psychiatrist
I hope that they will begin to find some relief
We would still like for you to come visit
I think I found the earrings she wants but I wanted to make sure
I need Tom over here ASAP
I don't wan't to postpone Tom's transfer any longer
It's good to hear from you
Now though his family has decided to stick it out with him instead of returning early
My only concern though is that his project may continue to drag on day-by-day
I think that she is graduating from Texas A&M
Please let me know if that is the case
In it we discussed the work performed to date the results and three options for proceeding
I would appreciate your response by this Friday
Did you mean to have an attachment to this e:mail
Could you get me a phyiscal copy of the review please
Yes it's good to have my hubby back
Just checking in with you
E-mail back when you can
Sometimes it is tough to have all assistants out at once
Would it work to start a little later in the afternoon
Hi Sally Hope you had a great Easter
I wanted to check with you before I asked for RSVP's
Plus we haven't all gotten together for awhile
Instead of having lunch or dinner maybe we can meet in between
I would love to accommodate as many assistants as possible
So if this conflicts with many of your schedules we can be flexible on the date
Hopefully this most recent operation will result in overall better health for him going forward
However I wanted to follow-up to confirm that we would be able to attend the Staff Mtg
I left some information regarding recruiting on the voice mail
If that was not clear please give me a call
How is your dad
Between meetings today I will construct a loose job description and e:mail that to you later today
Feel free to call me or respond via e:mail
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today
I enjoyed our discussion greatly
Keep me posted on date and time
Thanks for inviting us to your Monday staff meeting
If you're available it would be great if you could 'kickoff' the first 'Gas Ops' program
We'll keep you posted on schedule location etc
You have a ticket - we will see you there with you pager on
Patti will get your ticket to you before Thursday
I already have tickets for that game
Do I have your OKay
Theresa and I are pleased with the progam
I would like to request that Clara Carrington be added
Charlene Outlined below are the points I promised to send you before our meeting on Wednesday morning
Some of us had heard about the single July start date and some had not
Below are my suggested seven appointees to the Analyst Advisory Board
Attached is your latest expense report for your review
I do know Susan so I could probably approve this request
We can discuss when we get together on Friday morning
Although September would probably be OK it may be helpful it the review was moved to June/July
We would love to see all three of you
The upstairs is untouched however so you can make yourselves at home
I will let everyone know tonight and they will all be glad to see you
I haven't talked with Cara since the weekend so I didn't know that she might change her plans
I will try to catch her tonight
Just let me know on the $'s
I can send that whenever you might need it
I tried to call you back today but was told that you had left the office
They were good about answering your phone however
If I miss you I will ask my assistant to interrupt me when you call back
System would not allow me to submit request electronically
Hope your weekend was a good one
Have you seen Brent yet
I wanted to give you a quick update
Thanks for sending the announcement to me
Thank you again
Fall sounds good to me
Sally and Rick I am fine with having the dinner in the fall if y'all are ok with that
Actually it will give us more flexibility to plan and get great attendance
Please let me know your thoughts and I will communicate directly with Sue White
Sue Thanks for your email
So if that works for recepients and faculty then that would work our well
Sharron will let me know what Rick says today
Do you want me to notify the winners
I conveyed this via voice mail as Sue was not in her office
She wanted to be able to discuss our recommendations
However I think that it will be best to withhold the names of the recepients until after that conversation
She will most likely then contact you to confirm their names
Let me know how I can help with these arrangements
I have a number of questions First have the award winners been chosen
What are their names/phone numbers
Can you help us with the guest list from the university
Hopefully we can work that out this week
Glad you enjoyed the game
I already have this date on my calendar
Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you
I just wanted to say thanks for the Astros tickets
Thanks again for the tickets as well as all your support
Meant to copy you on this reply to Mike but forgot to do so before my initial send
That's good that you could watch from a lower level
My wife and I enjoyed it very much
When we arrived my wife became dizzy as she does in most high places
Per my voice mail message attached is a draft memo regarding Brent's role in London
Do you know what this is
ISO makes me think power
Is this something you can answer for Andrew
I have divided the tickets among you with my husband's help
For most games you will receive all six tickets
Your tickets will be distributed to you this week
I hope that you and your staff will enjoy these
Hi Sally Would you please approve and forward to Expense Report stating your approval
Sorry that we have missed one another by phone
Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you
I don't have a copy
I will be at the meeting on Thursday
I have asked Brenda Herod to attend as well
That way one or both of us will be able to attend
I will plan to attend
Can you attend as well
I know that you will be glad to see him
Please contact Ted or me if you have any questions
I will check voice mail messages during this time period but probably once or twice a day
I will be in the London office next week
Contact her if you need to speak directly with me
I will be responding to voice mail frequently throughout the week
The e:mail system never recognizes Rick Causey so you were dropped from the first distribution
I have to remember to type your full first name
I will be responding to voice mail messages throughout the week
Given the time difference you should receive thos reports via e:mail from AA on Wednesday
I'll look forward to seeing you
I saw a lot of Brent the last time he was here but haven't seen you in a while
I will call or email you tomorrow with a definite
Wanted to see if you Frank and Mo might be available for dinner one evening
Does it work for you with the baby to do evenings
I look forward to seeing you next week
In that meeting we will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior Specialists and below
I look forward to meeting with you next week
Kids on Spring break looking to spend some family time with them in San Antonio
I will look forward to meeting you
I will ask my assistant Lisa to work out the arrangements for you to see the accommodation
Thanks for your homework on this
Let us know what we need to do to schedule this
One of your earlier messages suggested meeting on Monday morning
Monday is great but we would have to make that an afternoon meeting
I have two options available below
Please let me know if you find these suitable
I would love to see Jo as well
Europe pay his costs NA pick up family costs
Though I believe you may be here sooner than that
The referral comes from James Scribner a guy that has just accepted a job offer from me
James and I worked together previously at a bank and he is very discerning in his evaluation of talent
His read is that she is very bright creative and innovative
I plan to be there through Thursday evening
Kevin Sweeney forwarded this message to me
If not I thought that you might be interested in this
For your approval
Attached is your revised expense report for your approval
I will talk with Kristin this afternoon
I agree that Edith would be great
I know Edith Cross would do a great job
I think that he would do a great job
I am glad that I avoided them
However I can be contacted at the hotel in the evening if needed
Rick Sorry I should have sent this to you several days ago
I have stated the goals but not the action plan to achieve the goals
I am working on those in some detail right now
Relative to Ilkka there is no harm in requesting it as well
Presuming he won't consent then we can discuss further
What are your views
I didn't see my name on the attachment
Do I have access to this
Please review and let me know any comments or questions
After a few suggested changes AA should forward a copy of this draft to you via e:mail later today
We would welcome your comments on the document and input on anything that you think we may have missed
I hope to start interviewing next week although I will only be in the office Monday through Wednesday
Feel free to move forward with whatever you need to do
I trust that I will have several good candidates to consider and Patti is doing a great job also
I will call the students this week
Keep me posted on what we hear from the students
I have personally called each to extend offers for summer internships
Please feel free to call and congratulate them
Could be persuaded to come with you when you return
Barry Sally asked me to forward this to you FYI
Sally asked me to forward this to you FYI
Sally asked me to forward this to you
I apologize for the short notice but with Sally going out of the country things have been really hectic
I am sorry about not making our meeting today
Your participation in this stage is vital as the final process will impact all of us
We look forward to working with you at the Offsite
I hope you have a successful trip
Please let me know how I can be of help
I am curious to hear your findings
Do you know much about her performance here at Enron
Can I call and talk with her directly
I would certainly keep the conversation confidential at this point
I need a list of accounting personnel in your group
I think that this was great too
I look forward to the next one
Would you like to coordinate dinner plans for the next lecture
I thoroughly enjoyed last night
Hi Sally Let's see if I can attach the correct Expense rpt
I do plan to make a trip to Calgary soon
I will find myself in South America next week in Sao Paolo and Buenos Aires
Congratulations on your promotion to Senior Director a promotion that is very well deserved
I follow your career within Enron with interest
Congratulations on your promotion to Senior Director
Please print a color copy of this for me
Can we schedule a meeting for Friday please
Friday won't work for me for lunch this week but Thursday is open for me at this point
Would that day work for you
If lunch won't work then we will plan some time on the calendar for Thursday or Friday
I will look forward to seeing you
How about our resources
I share your pain about increased deal flow
Should we not focus those resources on GCP
I am getting hammered on the exposure questions
Thanks for keeping me posted on this
Do let me know if there are further problems
However your memo says that the memo will be sent to all US employees of ENA
This made it
If so I will be on the way to South America on Sunday evening
If Chris' associate has any recommendations I would love to hear them
Let me know if you get this by e-mailing me back
We enjoyed seeing you also
Thanks for letting us crash temporarily at your house
Memo complete with exception of last paragraph write-up of your promotions
I am sorry Sally
I attached the wrong expense report
Thank you for calling me Patti
Again thank you for the effort and support Enron puts forth for our program
If we are running a little late we will be there shortly
I will be attending a funeral in Austin on Thursday
I will be back in the office on Friday
I will be out of the office on Tuesday so have a great time without me
Below is Stephen's expense report for your approval please
I mistakingly deleted file before all worksheets were printed
Please join us for a celebration of Energy Operations promotions hosted by ENA Energy Operations Management Team
Hope to see you there
Hope that all is well with you
He will call with his e:mail address
Thanks for forwarding mail to me
I apologize for the inconvenience of this
That was printed on my business cards many of which are still in circulation I am sure
Many thanks for all your help
I am out of the office all day on Wednesday
Please let us know as soon as possible
Thanks-- I think
I always have time for lunch
I am glad that you are enjoying Portland
I would love to see you
I hope that you are enjoying your role in EES
I know that you read notes mail messages very promptly
I will not be going away
Just wanted to let you know that I noticed the difference
Hope your are doing well
We will have to have lunch after you get through January
You will have to explain to me what the issue was
In that now we do not allow him to aggregate
Let us know what happens
Just let me know and I will be there
Woul dthis be useful for her
Please take these meetings off my calendar
Thank you for your participation in previous meetings
Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director
It is wonderful to see your contributions recognized in that way
Congratulations on your new role in the communciations company
John and I haven't talked about this need but I will certainly think about any likely candidates
Have you considered him
I would not panic
I will be very grateful for such additional material and information
Please update my listing for direct reports
Do you distribute a copy of this to my direct reports
If so please get an updated copy to them as well
I'd appreciate your help
I wish each one of you a happy new year
Thanks for keeping me posted on the PRC meeting
I would welcome your comments or questions
Please refer him to the second point in my e:mail as well as the attachment
Please let me know your preference for notification
I have worked very hard to assure a level of accuracy control and service in ENA operations
Through that hard work I believe that I have your confidence in my ability to deliver results
I would do nothing to jeopardize that
So at this point we feel confident about our system situation
More will unfold with counterparties next week but hopefully all found this as uneventful as have we
Hope your new year's celebration was fun
Effective immediately please invite your Energy Ops team representatives to all future meetings with the Commercial teams
I know that you must be busy at EES
Thank you for the copy
Contrary to your assumption this is the first Kristin or I have seen the draft
I think that is a good idea
As soon as schedules normalized following the holidays I will be back to you with a name
Whom would you recommend play this role for Energy Operations
Did you get a copy of this
Do you have details behind this
Cris had started some dialogue with accounting however I have seen nothing come forth
Thank you for your assistance on these items
This is what we sent to A/P
Let me know if we need to resend
I will put the back-up in mail to A/P
Please print and put this in my folder for PRC
I have not worked directly with Sheri Thomas until last week
She was understanding and responsive to my request
While these locations are not prime spots people will need to occupy them as our business continues to grow
If Chantelle is not available Maria Sandoval will be her backup
I would also appreciate your help in cleaning up the floor including the window spaces
They are on the west side of the building just outside my office
Unfortunately I will be on vacation next week and will not be able to attend
We would be honored if you can attend
Hope you can make it
I would handle this through expense reimbursement
I would love to visit with you about a rotation
I plan on being on vacation next week but I will be working between Christmas and New Years
What are your plans
So get back to me with your schedule
You are right -- we are all in the same boat
Keep me posted and I will let you know if I hear anything new
I plan on restarting my attendance at these meetings on Wednesday
I thought that if asked three that this should work on one of their schedules
I will let you know later who will attend
I will be out of the office that day
Are you or a designate going to this
Today I decided to recap in writing for everyone
Thought that you might be interested
The attachment below recaps our meeting from this morning
Let me know if anything has been left off the list
We have not heard from them this morning
I will keep you posted on any further developments
I will be out of town on Thursday
If you can make it please try to attend
I have put this meeting on my calendar
I will also have details of resource needs
I will welcome your comments on the timeline
Teresa PS if I have missed anyone please pass on the good news
I hope that everyone is doing well
I know that there were ten invitations needed including Mom and Dad
I will do invitations this weekend
Do you have the address for Josephine's House
And do we have a time
I think someone in Victoria
Saying it is busy here sounds a bit like a broken record but it is busy here
I am really enjoying having Beth Apollo on the team
She has already made a very positive impact while she is learning the details of the operations side
How is life treating you
I know that their is a lot going on in the London office as well
Do you have plans to be in Houston any time soon
Thought you might be interested in these two changes
I do appreciate Mary's personal decision however and I know that you will join me in wishing Mary well
Keep me posted on the impact of losing that day
Feel free to call if you have any questions
I assume that Kathryn has communicated this to you
We need consistent stable days of testing before I will feel comfortable
Thought you might want to know
If you have any comments please get with me as soon as time permits
Please let me know if you have any additional questions
Patti will have numbers where I can be reached in Austin
I am e:mailing you a current draft version although it does not yet reflect all of the changes needed
Memo on floor meetings plus my reply to Greg and Philippe
Lets talk about it in more detail tomorrow
This will be an important meeting for me to attend
Let me know when this gets scheduled
I will have my assistant Jennifer Bryan contact your assistants to schedule a time that fits
If you have any questions please do not hesistate to call
You can take up the cause with Philippe when he returns
I expect to review a draft by this Friday
Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting
If that doesn't work we will simply do one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone
When you and I met we discussed most of these names
I added the Calgary guy and Max
Do you want to add any names
Are we close to having this
Should she be notified as well
Let me know if that date will work for you
We have improved our tickets this year
Patti I left Cindy a message last week about attending the NCL convention later in April
I won't bury you with constant examples but am copying you on this note regarding floor meetings
I may or may not attend but want to have that on the calendar just in case
We'll see you the next time
Would you like to be included
I will ask Patti to get with you on the details
Greg and I talked about this today
If he and his wife are available I will let you know details as it gets closer
Given our ASP model we have to offer a system even more robust than EOL
Can you get that list form Vanessa
It looks like I've deleted my copy
I should have an answer by Monday
I have already notified the winners so please join me in congratulating each one on a job well done
If so I would like to get my own gift for them if that is okay
Does Louise know if it is a boy or girl
I will be getting a gift basket from Saks Fifth Avenue
I will send a reminder closer to the date
Please call me with any questions
Thanks in advance for your help on this matter
Please print in color for me
Do we have a file set up for these
Imagining that for myself it would not be a pretty site
Was it just a lot of movement or was there noise as well
Use your imagination
I have let Bob know about Louise's praise
Thought that you would like to know as well
Calgary will need a special message and we may have to go to Calgary to deliver it
You and I can discuss that in more detail
Are you comfortable with this plan of attack
I will probably make pumpkin chiffon and lemon/raspberry pie so pecan would be a great addition
I recently cleaned out the guest room closet bought new towels and have ordered new luggage racks
I am such a lovely sister yes
We are looking forward to having you all here
We are looking forward to Thanksgiving--can't believe it is next week
What can we bring
I think that I mentioned her to you
Sounds like fun but I won't be able to make it
I am forwarding your message to Beth Apollo
She will be closer to this than I
You may want to get her feedback as well
I would love to see it too
Sally It is on the list as a medium priority and we can discuss more on Monday
I would not say that the system is totally done
Do you want to have a look before it rolls out
Thanks in advance for you help on this
Got your note
Can we delay until then
Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date
Hey you have to start somewhere
Next week I can give you more info on that
Will we divert critical resources from these efforts
Beth does it make sense for that referral to be James or you or Vanessa
Can you advise who might know anything about this system
He tells me that it is in your area of responsibilities
We will get back with you on this shortly
She had recently reviewed it with Brenda Herod I believe
I will be glad to help in any way
I don't recognize the names
If you would like to volunteer for these events please drop me a note
I will look forward to reading the details later today
If there are any questions or feedback please let me know
Can you print this for me
I will be glad to handle invitations
I still have a copy of it but haven't focused on it to date
Mom sent me the pictures from the hospital with Anna
I could easily be mistaken for her grandmother I'm afraid
I believe you do the same in Europe
Sally and I will do what ever you guys decide
Wes you know what I think and what we've decided on
If however you would like to discuss the matter further please contact John Sherriff
Thanks for your note and resume
I appreciate you consideration and look forward to meeting you
Resume attached per my voice mail to you
Sally wasn't quite sure what you wanted
She put together a little something - if you can use it fine if not that's fine too
Substitutes may be sent provided they have satisfied all course prerequisites
This order needs to be authorized before it is processed
Upon Mary's review Anne will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures
I am missing a second page of attendees or were only a few listed
We will get you back on the official distribution list
For now I am forwarding our weekly report to you
I can't have everyone go at the same time
If this is not on target we will keep working until it is
Do you have a hard copy that I can see
Also do you know who I'd contact in EES
Thank you Cassandra
Do you know what I'm talking about
Or should I talk to Lloyd or Oliver
But last year we had thought about just a small lunch with the students and a few from Enron
Both had worked in managerial roles in our natural gas business reporting to Brent Price
Previously she was a senior director managing our Global Databases group
Unfortunately her recent health problems will curtail her involvement going forward
I will add these to our Hot List
Let me know about the A/R
Would love to hear about your trip in more detail
Do you have anything firm from her
I really enjoyed visiting with you over dinner
Please let me know what your start date will be
It was a pleasure meeting you and I hope we can keep in touch
Now that is me
I am so glad that you will be able to interview
I will look forward to seeing you in Austin on Wednesday
I have made flight arrangements and will see you on Wednesday
Sally asked me to set up several meetings for next week
Please let me know your availability
Please print for me
Sorry that I will not be able to attend
However she will be on vacation next week
Can you give me any info that may be made available
If not by e-mail is it something that can be faxed
Consequently we cannot accept any charges from EAS for travel expenses
If you have any other questions give me a call
Also please send me a copy of the complete response to the RFP assuming you have that
I would like to see the whole thing
Have you heard any more about this
I didn't see it on my calendar
This does conflict with Philippe's Thursday staff meeting I believe
However I don't feel that everyone is ready to make that decision
In some cases I don't see it being possible at all
Put me down as a fan of the doorstop review process
I got the message that you couldn't meet this afternoon
I want this to be a concerted and not disjointed effort
Probably okay for him to start this effort in that way
Prove concept and then we can consider the wisdom of partnering with someone else
I spent some time with him today
I met with Louise today on this
I will get you a draft for your comments
I am comfortable that we have devised a good plan
Operational Risk Another key area that we are focusing on is the HPL sale
He likes the revisions that we have made
Beth Apollo on my team is leading this effort
Patti has contact numbers for me if needed
I will let Patti know when we get back in town
Meant to copy you on this note
I will definitely look for you in San Antonio
I would love to hear about your new role
We miss seeing you in ENA
I will need to review them when I am back
We are holding up on our open reqs for now however will pass onto IT
Please let me know if you are interested
Randy told me to send my information
Please give me a call if you have any questions
I think that this sounds like a good plan
I look forward to your feedback
I will put that on my calendar
Thanks for your comments on the standards
Yes we are gleaning this information from those that are responsible for these activities
For instance small power deals that were done in Calgary before they had a power book set up
By having a prescribed elevation of these exceptions we should get the appropriate attention to correct them
I hope the result was good
We are going to work on a transition period for him
Please let me know of any questions that you have
I will make the next meeting
Thanks and let me know if you need any additional information
Thanks for sending me your thoughts from the meeting you attended
These are interesting and definitely can relate to some of the things that we discussed in Dallas
But we would have to make sure we could cope to
I will let you know tomorrow
Thank you Sally
I will send him an invite
Will you and your family be joining us
I suspect that you meant to include Bob Hall the VP that reports to me on this mailing list
Unfortunately these new dates don't work for me
I am in need of interviewers still
I am scheduling the same greeters to return
As you can see I need three interviewers
How should I do this
Thanks for your message
I thought that John did have responsibility for risk and I am glad to have that clarified
Thanks for taking the time to meet with me today
You gave me some valuable insights and suggestions
I do want to correct one misstatement that I made
I am looking forward to meeting with you again soon
I look forward to seeing you
I can make other days work as well
Thank you in advance for your support
We should all continue looking for more companies with whom we can draw parallels
Sally if you know of others which might be more directly related please let us know
If so I will ignore this
I will be following up with Beth Apollo Brenda Herod and Brent Price to explore opportunities in their areas
I am ordering the video from competition so we can show you the routines sometime
I had a lot of fun
But it was nice to get back to Houston yesterday
Keep me posted on baby news
Hi - Had my doctor's appt
Just keeping you posted
Please adjust your calendars accordingly
I will call with the ones that have moved on
Tried you this morning from the car and missed you
Do you want to talk Thursday morning during my commute
A great time to support her and be around her friends
And nicely enough she asked me to be a chaperone
As of last week we have redirected Shona's reporting line to Beth Apollo
Soon after she returns she will review and update the suggested doorstep review schedule
I will check messages at the end of both business days
Certainly if we are able to generate revenue that will be a great offset to our expenses
The update had the exact opposite effect that Joel wanted I am sure
But I also had concerns over quality of staff as well
To this end I have recently studied possible options for reaching the targeted savings
As a result I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team
Let me know if you have any questions regarding this
While it was a tough decision I feel comfortable having made it
If you can join them you might find it interesting
Tell me what I can do to help you but I am probably shorter on time than anything
But if I can get you get addresses or whatever let me know
Maybe someday we will be there
It was so fun being with you on Saturday.
Also setup an automatic payment each month to begin to pay you back.
Also I would like to review and perhaps edit the principal projects/deals section each week before distribution
Please let me know if that will work for you
Thank you very much for your help
Thanks for your nice note
Keep me posted on what you are doing
I appreciate your time and energy in representing me
Thanks for much for your nice note
Where are you working now
I hate to say that I have lost track
You definately earned it
Also I had added Bob Hall to the previous Hot List meeting
First of all allow me to express my congratulations for your promotion
Congratulations on your promotion
I have only taken a quick look at the attachment but thought that I would forward it to you
In order to stay flat year on year I split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups
I am glad that you and Kristin are getting together
However I don't see a spot on the website to check that information
Can you provide more details
I hope that all will attend and participate
Keep me posted on progress
A few weeks away but at least it is on the calendar
I am comfortable with your decisions so feel free to go ahead with this
Don't I know...they are smart and loving but a little short on the details sometimes aren't they
I had a deadline so did not attend--Richard did
I have no problem putting it on my card for now
I would be glad to do that
Thanks for your input
I bet I will talk with you later today on your special day
Sorry please disregard last email - I did not see this follow-up notice
We have a staff meeting at that time - Stacey Sally nor I will be able to go
Please let me know if you have any questions or conflicts
Would you please run it by Kevin
Cara would you like for me to hold the reservation on my credit card
Don't know how much baby stuff may be hitting yours so I would be glad to do so
What do you guys think
Should we explore other options - or just go with this
I'll keep you posted
Please print attachment for me
Thanks for your vote of confidence
Have already had some discussions with him about some involvement there
If anyone can you'll do it
Wouldn't it be the four of us
I'll call you this weekend
Doing a deal test tells us what does happen
Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan and I believe that Fernley was involved in that session as well
At my suggestion she also contacted Joe Gold to inform him of her findings
And if that was the case I apologize for that
I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and myself
This meeting should have been with Ted and me
We don't however control which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react
The findings create a dialogue between the business units RAC and Operations which I believe is healthy
Please change this on my calendar
I suspect this is a result of that
If she hasn't already told you about that meeting you may to visit with her on that
I'll keep you updated
Entelligence is being used in Houston so they must have done training here
Patti is setting up my meeting with James for Friday
Again I will leave you a message to let you know that we have had that conversation
Are they on an Enron network
Do they get Enron e:mails
I look forward to seeing you in Dallas
I would like to see the training so I can get familiar with the product
Have they delivered it in Houston at all
Any issues you think I should discuss with him
I know there is a doorstep outstanding for the NY office
I will see you in Dallas on Monday morning
I gave his review the end of last week but didn't get to review the reporting change
Looks like he still has some homework to do
I will follow up with Avril
Hopefully you will find the EnTelligence system a useful tool for each of you
If you have any questions or concerns please let me know
I think that she is well organized and control minded
Managing a group of people is probably not her strongest attribute
I am not sure that people enjoy working under her
Do you know of her
Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there
Yes - let's plan on my house on Sunday
Hearing it from a woman's point of view would be interesting
I have call into Bob Lindsay policeman and NCL dad about safety. we will see.
I thought I might try to get some brief info from Ann YOung on Applause Theatre our new phil.
Also I can check with the three on nominations and see when they are available will let you know.
If you don't mind having regular ticktocker meeting at your house that would be great.
Can we do TT meeting at your house
I will email agenda for that meeting to you.
Please put Mike on my calendar for Thursday lunch next week
I will deal with Louise's meeting in another way
Thursday lunch sounds good - you know I love Mexican
Thanks for getting appointments organized for him
I look forward to seeing you in Dallas next week
I am glad that you Richard and Steve will be able to participate
We can do lunch on Thursday or Friday if your schedule allows
I will not be able to attend
I am going to have to miss the luncheon tomorrow
I will get an update from Shona
I can go either way on dinner for Wednesday night
Let me know which works better for you
If you have problems or concerns please feel free to contact me
This was our first third party auction
Please let me know if you have any comments or feedback
I will be in Calgary Wednesday and Thursday this week
Tuesday is tough because I am trying to finish giving performance reviews
I can make time on Tuesday but would prefer that we hold this to an hour
I had the same reaction
And do we have a volunteer to host the meeting
I could certainly host if needed
Meagan is signed up to take them
If we have a lot of conflicts then this may not work
Tomorrow I will see what I can pull together and try to catch you Monday pm or Tuesday am.
Congratulations on your promotion to Manager
We would like the opportunity to help you celebrate your promotion
I couldn't agree with you more
Mike missed the point of our phone call this week
I have a one-hour conference call set up with Mike tomorrow
This is one of the things that we will discuss
I am right about this
That puts me in Calgary for the staff meeting on Wednesday
Due to location constraints we will have to keep that meeting as scheduled
Haven't made it there myself
Hope you guys get to see each other
Julie called me immediately after getting my e:mail message about you
Wanted to know if you would be interested in that
Told her that I couldn't speak for you
You may not then be interested in her rotation but you'll know more and she will know you
FYI - she is a University of Nebraska graduate
Congratulations on the birth of your little girl
Just a quick note to see how you are doing
I mentioned your name today to Kristin Albrecht
Kristin and I used to work together in Enron Americas and we had lunch today to catch up
She can be another contact for you here at Enron
His first rotation has been on my team working as a risk book administrator in gas trading
His background and your business seem to be a good fit
It will be well worth your time
I hope that you will be able to participate
I will call you tonight
If you don't get anyone to talk with John Rodgers don't worry about it
Hopefully Lexi will have their resumes for you tomorrow
I will be in touch on details
I agree - he does look like a good candidate
Let me know if this resume looks interesting to you
Also who should I send this to in London
I am attaching my resume for your review
Please put the dates referenced below on my calendar
I will be at both events so there will be an Enron face at both events
Please let me know if you will be available
Do you need me for either of those two dates
Sorry that I couldn't stay but I know that the students were in good hands
If you are available to attend please let me know
If you have any questions or suggestions please let me know
Watch for her call
She is a very quick learner and her documentation and process-oriented skills are exceptional
I will look forward to talking with Norma
Thanks for suggesting that she contact me
Can you upgrade me to first class
Glad to hear that we are getting there
Maybe we can do this
Richard asked him about the anniversary thing
This also reflects so well on our entire organization
She will check with Dad and let you know
I don't quite get all of this either
If I get to be like Mom or Dad smack me around ok
I do know Jana
I will let you know what he thinks
If I remember correctly she was originally a teacher who went back to school to get a business degree
Would you recommend her
I've attached my resume for your review and consideration
I look forward to hearing from you soon
Not sure that this reached you the first time
They are sending me a brochure
I would probably take two rooms one for the girls and one for Tyler David and me
But we would probably do that in New York or San Francisco too
As we all know five is almost too many in one room and bathroom
Also it pushes the travel even further into the year which may help you
Thank you for the invitation
Yes I will be there for the tour and dinner
I believe most of us will be there
Auctions - Buy the things you want at great prices
I am have been unable to open the invitation however I will be attending
Thank you very much for the invitation
I look forward to attending and I thank you for supporting our Energy Management program at OU
Glad to hear that it just seemed to be a virus
It looks pretty good in the photos and you can see the mountains
Hope all is well with the three of you
Please stop by as soon as you have pictures
I would love to see them
I was in the London office last week
By copy of this memo I am asking James to do the same with you
Thank you for taking the time to attend our presentation I truly hope you found it informative
Hopefully I can report some positive results at our next presentation
Hopefully you can tell me who that is
I will be in touch tomorrow on details
Hopefully Lexi will have resumes for you
If not let me know and some of us who interviewed on campus may have them still
Thanks for your note and welcome back to Enron
I am so pleased that you have returned
I too look forward to working with you
Forgot to cc you on this
Please put attendees on my calendar
Here is the conference room Poly-Com number for Ted Rita mentioned he prefers to call in
Sorry that all we managed last week was a wave
Mike Jordan kept my schedule very full but productive and even lunches and dinners were filled with business meetings
Do stop by when you are in the office next week
I should be in town all week
Thanks too for your comments on the OpRisk session
First of all congratulations on your promotion it is well deserved
If my full e:mail address is not used Steve Beck gets my e:mails
I'm trying to book her a room for Tuesday evening
Is it you and Philippe or will the report be distributed to all on your memo distribution list
Wonderful news of your well deserved recognition
Can you get me info on the options with Dell
I won't make it by to speak with them myself today
Just wanted to send my congratulations
I know that you really deserve this promotion
Thanks for looking out for me
If it should be more let me know
Thanks for all your hard work with the girls
I need that date before I can proceed
I think it might be today but I need to confirm that before I have everything switched over
I can handle that
I will put in request today
Hopefully Lexi will have resumes for you tomorrow
Sorry that our goodbye was so abrupt

How can I help move this forward
Thanks too for spending part of your weekend in the office
Will do the best we can

Don't know what works best with your schedule
Ernie is targeting Tuesday to discuss Canadian operations so it could be helpful for you to be here
Can you call me today with an update
James responded and filled me in on the issue
Sounds like we need the automated link to solve future problems
How are we going to clean up the existing backlog
Did you know that this had grown so large
Let's talk about how we can manage this better
SInce your name was not on the original list I am forwarding this to you
However you also requested other questions
In addition I have a couple of suggestions for what could be done to build badly lacking morale
I appreciate your efforts
I have sent this to my two supervisors as well
Mark Taylor will join us from Legal this afternoon
Did you know about this meeting
Seems like you should be there
Can you nose in with Jim
Would you enlarge the attachment so I can print for Sally
Christina Sally attached is our list of contractor reductions
Sally - I am actually based in London
All cash outflows have an impact so it is probably best just to emphasize not spending unnecessary dollars
I think that you could share this with the assistants
I am trainable and very willing
Please respond only if you are unable to attend
Thanks for you time and attention to this
Say hello to Jo for me
I am happy to answer your questions
Feel free to send me others as the come up
Could you please tell me if we will be receiving reviews bonuses or raises
How soon could we have answers to these
Sorry those didn't get to you yesterday
He was gone for the day and I tried his cell phone but didn't get an anwer
I will catch up tomorrow
Hope that you made it to the soccer play-off game tonight
Left you a message that Beth Jeff and Brent are all here and working on their respective pieces
I'll have my cell with me at all times
Great work again from your team
Are we having some fun now
Sorry - I read the first e-mail before seeing this one
I am sure it is even tougher now
On Rick's behalf she was asking about London operations
I assume that you have covered that
Let me have your final numbers when you can
FYI - response after my call to Brian
Agreement refers to employees of Enron Americas or its subsidiaries and those employees involved in natural gas specifically
Thanks - Anne did call me this morning with the details
I think that your Phibro card is from our original meeting in New York a lifetime or two ago
Kind of a cool building but weird because it is not really finished
Not exactly sure how we were able to swing an occupancy certificate but we are here
I would love to get together with you
Enjoy your Thanksgiving in London
Sally I have been thinking of you and the first time we met at a conference in New York
While it must be difficult for your people they could do a lot worse than have you in charge
I hope to speak to you soon
Have a nice Thanksgiving with your families
Did you get the job
I certainly hope so
Ireally appreciate it
Iam so sorry things have gone the way they have
Lord knows you've all taken care of me
Iwish you nothing but the best
I am saving your e-mail address and phone number
There may be an occasion for us to work together again
Best wishes for you and your family
Can you hold on this until after mid-week this week
If waiting until after mid-week makes the timing diffcult for planning purposes I might suggest a less costly version
At the bank where I was before we occassionally had get-togethers where we all brought something to the party
For my direct reports and spouses
Need to get planning if I get the go ahead
Are you ok with that
And if so would you and David want to come too
Understand your request and you have my assurance that I will be very up-front with you
No breaking news to share with you however
Would love to get your input on the organization going forward if you have time tomorrow
I tried not to bother you today
I guess things look pretty bleak
Did that and what comes up looks like it is in tongues
Unfortunately I can't read anything but hopefully Nancy was able to review it
Unless Lori got that article to you in another way we are missing that from the newsletter
Hope that you are enjoying the new place
Did you have a wonderful Thanksgiving
Luckily our aunt had the big dinner at her house - no trying to cook among the boxes

Do you contemplate that Netco would trade those commodities/products
Sorry that I couldn't make the meeting
What is your calendar like for drinks next week
He was not considered a very smart cookie wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes
Toward the end it was thought that he would rise again but alas he was no tart
He is also survived by his elderly father Pop Tart
I will ask around and see if anyone knows anything
Who can work on this for us
Does any of this make sense to the two of you
I thought I would pass this on
I do not think Carolyn Gilley is here any longer
Here's the contact list Sally asked I forward to you
Yes I think that it makes sense to keep the system available over the weekend for the foreseeable future
I had operations teams accessing critical data available only in SAP on Friday evening and Sunday this past weekend
It is very likely that our need to do so will continue unlimited to weekdays
The notice you received today was a reminder notice
You are welcome to join us in this meeting
Or should it be Brian
I think that I will propose that to Lavorato today
Can you re-check
Also I understand Zufferli bot a ton of NG and I thought he was short
Bill thought that our curves were way off
I have gotten one story from Brent
What do you know about this
Sorry that we didn't get together today
I hope that you and your family have a great Christmas
Your champagne is under my desk
I hope that you and Craig will enjoy it
I haven't seen it yet since we talked this morning
Since I haven't received the list yet please send it to both Bob Hall and me
Thanks for your call a few weeks back
I need the break
We thought it would be a fun trip with our seniors
Hopefully we will all come back in one piece

I have no idea what her decision will be

Randy did we have problems this weekend
Just let us know how you would like to handle
Given our recent discussions and the beginning of the heating season this is very timely
Thanks for sharing your expertise

Glad you are back

Ricki are you planning on Ava covering for you next week when she gets back
Or is Alma covering for you
I will be on vacation Monday Tuesday and possibly Wednesday
Sorry for being so evasive but things are still in a state of turmoil for me
Does anyone have customers they would like to take
Please let me know the date name of customer and customer company ASAP
I don't think anything has changed
I just wanted to be sure I had the right understanding
Shelley has never requested anyone to cover for her
Have things changed and no one told me
Rick Mike and Jodie we reviewed the attached recommendation and wanted to pass on an idea to you
Mike thank you for the update
Thanks again for your support and follow up
Just wanted to touch base with you on todays activities
Here is our first draft
Please keep me posted if we are not going to meet Wed dead line
Otherwise I am available on those two afternoons
Is there anyone else I need to include
Please share this with your staff
Should I be updating PLE to reflect the change
Therefore I am unable to produce the reports until th= is has been resolved
Mary Kay is sending me Christophers today hopefully
But now we are re-thinking that we would like to have a dollar-valued OBA with daily cash out
Ava go ahead and get you a new printer
Please let me know if there ar= e any changes
Also please let me know if there are others that need to be added to this = mail list
Give me a call if you have any questions about Chris
I am recommending him for a position within your team
Per my conversation with Mary Kay attached is a resume for Chris Miller
For these reasons I would like to recommend Chris for a position within your group
Working in this fast-paced environment many of you are already familiar wi= th recording transactions conducted by telephone
Please call me if you have any questions about this arrangement
Ava how should we handle
Ava here is the other email I got on expense report
Where can I find online documentation on Concur Expense
Enter your birth date as the password in the following format MMDDYYYY
How can I view my old expense reports
How do I enter foreign currency into Concur Expense
Thought you might like to see this
Speaking of family my daughter J'Nel has grown up to be a wonderful beautiful responsible and extremely lovable daughter
I am very proud of her
The data we need is not currently available by point only contract
Also it would be nice to turn over the code we have to someone in IT for long-term implementation
Lynn what are your thoughts
Ava just wanted to be sure you saw this
Terry would you work with Darrell on this issue and let me know outcome
When we do cash out I think that we should deduct these penalties from their payment
Donna I want to be sure we put this in Friday's bullets if Mary leaves it out
This is signifcant for her as well as the North Team
I hope it is a good time for everyone else
We hope to see you there
Larry and Raetta did Randy do this on his own
Jut come by and get it
If I have throughly confused you give me a call
Julia got your message last night
Steve and I wondered if you would be available for lunch Tuesday Wednesday or possibly Thursday next week
We would love to see you and Dave
Let us know
We can meet you wherever it is convenient for you
Terry and John do you have Mike's desk covered on those two days
I do not have a problem with it
Please let me know if there is a problem
Ava did you recieve this message
Well guys sorry it has taken me so long to get this out

A little higher capacity than we had anticipated

Brad sorry I did not get the message to Ava before she sent this out
Cost centers is Donna's responsibility to work with us

Rosemary - Could you please forward this to everyone in Marketing
After discussing the rate changes with our customers we are hopeful that the latest filing will be approved
Becky yes I got a note as well
Hope all is well for you
I enjoyed the opportunity to work with you on Mauro's trip
Hi Lynn - Did you get a copy of this from Mauro
I thought it was very touching
Wish me luck trying to find it in that mess everything is in boxes
I know it's on a diskette somewhere so please bear with me
If I can't find it should I recreate it and if so are there any changes
Thought you might be interested in this info
We will keep you posted
Dale's team can implement these changes when ever they desire
Please call Mike or I with questions
Ava did you send out last weeks notes
If so can you resend to team advisors and coordinators
Shelley I think you want to continue using this report
We can discuss further if you like
Given the Oneok Arbitration Decision does it make sense to continue to send this report out
Sheila could I have one of the nights next week to give to Laura for Astro tickets
I'll give you one of mine
The reason being is that it was already written into the script and tested
If you have any questions please ask me
You may contact me at ext
Brad do we need to bump this concern up a level
We appreciate your help
Dale would you let me know if everything looks OK in our systems for all three pipes
But just in case if there was a problem it may be associated with this change
I have no doubt that if there is a problem everyone has my number
We will keep you apprised of progress
And if my name pops up let me know
Todd I am planning on attending both the Sunday event as well as the meeting on Monday
I look forward to the meetings
Mike and Terry does this impact our storage numbers for July
After looking into the issue we discovered that the data was never making it from the database
This led us to believe there was a driver incompatibility issue
I have tested it and am happy with the results
I can give a more detailed explanation if you like just let me know
Please let me know if you need any additional information
I said let me know who is coming
She is sending me a list
Hopefully we can resolve this at that time
I really appreciate your assistance
Lynn I forgot to let you know that I am only available on Wed
Ava that is fine with me
Now that we are between PRC periods I believe it is the most opportune time to present this program
It is no cost to your organization
All that is needed from you is your support
In fact your attendance would set a great example
Participants are asked to contact my assistant Miranda Southard by e-mail to enroll in any of these sessions
Also if there is another location that I should target please let me know that as well
Thanks for your support
Lunch will be provided for those in Houston office please let me know if you will be attending
Look forward to seeing you tomorrow
Hopefully they will get their quota of rain the next two weeks and we will have clear weather
If it is Thursday I will reshuffle my meetings
Thanks for letting me know about the change in plans
I will distribute an e-mail notification to all the participants
Perhaps we can reschedule to hold during the morning
In looking at LSF we were not able to determine that any one zone over pulled
Hopefully this helps to identify some of your concerns
I would like to be included on receiving the log weekly
As we originally discussed this can only be done if all EFM problems are funneled through the Measurement Desk
Mike our objective is to send the log out weekly
Is there a way I or the region Directors could see the log who was contacted etc
One of you may want to set in on this meeting
If not I can bring you up to speed
Vernon yes you can do pool to pool transactions on an MPS agreement
Vernon please see my answers in red
Sounds like you had a great meeting
Let me know if you need any other info
Three of them are questions for you
John will get you the fields
I'll let you know
Just let me know if they call you I am sure I can find SOMEONE to go to Virginia
In particular now that we will have to report nominated vs scheduled to the Cal
If you have any questions please e-mail me or page me
Ava would you please designate these on my calendar
Larry and Raetta could you touch base with Kathy and see if you can help her out
I think we need to look at this together
Rich or Toby can verify that for us
One thing that is different on TW is our processis to confirm before we allocate
Dale I need to know what is the schedule for the posting of the Unsubscribed
Do we run when these are complete
Should we post based on the confirmation time
Do we follow these times even if Noms is late
Thought I would pass this on
Would you like to discuss further
I may have led Vernon astray
Lynn see Mike's comment I highlighted in red below
Can you please set me straight once again
Doesn't mean she won't ask about delivery
However my NNG rep Robert Benningfield informs me that he and other reps might not be allowed to attend
What do you think of that idea
Attached is your list for final ratings
Please call us if you have any questions
Larry and Raetta do you agree with Dari's comment
I think we should do a settlement of the accounts receivable
Although the effect is the same it would be better to be able to say that we don't retier
Lynn or Janet feel free to straighten me out if I have the story confused
That would be my choice
Please let me know if you have questions or concerns
Also he's in a brace from his armpits to his hips which he says is extremely hot
We're ready to welcome him back but go easy on him
Dana the signed copy after the meeting is fine with me
Please let know if you have any questions
Lynn I was getting ready to schedule our July/August Monthly Staff Mtg
Do any of you know if we use this Right Fax
John can you help me put together the presentation we want for the Winter Ops meeting
Lynn and Steve I think you can answer this question below on the posting
Can you get back to us & let us know
The issue she is having now is when to post
Toby Have you already covered this issue below from Jeanne
If so can you respond back to Tina & Jeanne
If you do not know can we meet & discuss so we can get them an answer by Tuesday
If you can coordinate and finalize this schedule while Dale is out it will help us move forward
If you have any other questions please call me as Tina is also out of the office until Tuesday
Please let me know if you need more info than that
Glen do you want us to call you in your office
That seem to make her feel better anyway
We would love to have you join us
I will be on vacation but Terry Kowalke and Steve January can cover for me
Hope it all ended well
Hopefully it won't again until the next time
Thanks for all your patience and support
By the way I hear you are going on a cruise to Alaska
Have a great time you deserve it
Toby thanks for the way you sent this note to folks
Are you aware of this
Do you guys agree with Vernon's answers
Donna I wanted to let you know this for budget purposes
Vernon looks good to me
Did you receive
I have worked with Amy Mulligan Cynthia Rivers Linda Ward Christine McEvoy and Bert Hernandez
In short I could not have made the progress I have without Bert's help
I thought I'd better send this now as opposed to waiting for PEP lest I forget
I also believe that good news shouldn't wait
We don't always hear enough of it
If you have any questions please let Dannis or I know
Could you guys coordinate on covering this visit
As per our phone conversation please read below my message re
You may want to contact him directly
To my opinion Northern would be all right
So I already have a relatively good general knowledge of the american system
Going to Omaha would not be a problem for me
Among of meetings I'm going to arrange it would be of interest a visit at a major pipeline
Northern seems to me a good example
Would you envisage it as a possible example for me
Please join me in congratulating Rachel on her promotion
If you will forward it to me

Donna I need one laptop computer for Terry or John to use when they are out of town
Please put them on the list

If you are not able to attend a representative from your team needs to attend in your place
Just remind me
Raetta if you hear anything different please let me know
In the event that unforeseen circumstances prevent this from happening I will let you know
Raetta if we could have an update before I go to Omaha next Monday I would appreicate it
Raetta Can you provide an update for Lynn
Per our conversation over the last few weeks Gas Logistics needs the following imbalance information
If you attended last year it would be good to give someone else an opportunity this year to attend
If you have any questions about the conference you can give me Larry or Raetta a call
Fran here is the draft we worked on today
Dale what is the status of your research on this project
Were we able to get to a zone level
Have they been terminated
They seemed to be okay with that and I think they will change the way they nom now
Are you guys in the office on that day
Please let me know if you are available or not
Rob and Teb this is the agenda I left you a message about
He was given either Ginger Dernehl or myself as initial contacts
I had not thought about that
Also I can put more info in an email notice
I think this will take the majority of the afternoon
John can you plan on attending
But you can go ahead and get this to Debbie
Karen no problem we can call you in for your part only
I will contact Ranelle
Thank you for responding to our invitation
Sharon I found the agenda you sent out and Vernon sent it to Virginia Power

Brad I thought we were re-arranging the meeting to do Rates and Revenue before the other topics
Otherwise looks good to me
Pat thank you for sending this to me
Do you by chance have Bill's home address
In case you weren't I thought I would pass it on
I did not want to forget these items
Charlie I agree we should get payment either way
Thanks for your help getting this pushed along
You can see by the trail of e-mails below they seem to brush us off about once a month
Charlie I talked with Mike Belcher and Jon Hanna about this on Friday for an update
If determined that the liquids do have condensate in them we will pursue retroactive settlement with the current hauler
Hopefully we will bring this to a close very soon
Do you need anything more from NNG
Jodie Toby Steve and I are planning on reviewing and performing a practice run on our presentations
Anyone that wants to join us is welcome
Please review and let Dari and I know of any changes additions etc
I am updating the Oneok issues list
I definitely think we should let customers know as needed basis
John and Terry are there other customers who download our rates
ENA loads our rates into their system
Raetta or Larry do either one of you have the SMS chart on line
I only have a hard copy
If you could help Courtney out I would appreciate it
Ava I think it is a great idea
If Shelley is OK with it would you please coordinate the effort
This is money she had left over from our group
Guys sorry we left off the day
Thought you might be interested
Linda please keep me in the loop on both of the projects since they interface directly with TMS
Randy I think it would be a good idea to do some training in Omaha
Then we can do it in one trip
Once this information is automated I will also be able to send those via email or other methods
I'll keep you informed
Ava please add to my calendar
Alfredo I am pretty open for the rest of today and tomorrow as well

Mike is this what you are looking for
If I need to talk to anyone to help you get the referrel let me know

Lynn Randy added me to the distrubution
Do you want to send Roberts mother some flowers
The surgery went well and his mother is doing fine
Robert is going to stay at his mom's until Friday
Robert's mother fell and broke one of her wrists this afternoon
Do you still want to go to Lunch
Janet I will add Harry to your evaluation
This does cause me a good deal of concern
She is also new again to scheduling so all those facets of my performance would be missing
At the end of the day none of this may matter but it is a concern today
Randy make sure someone is up to speed on your process that can represent you in the meeting
Donna I am not going to worry about this unless you tell me I need to
I wasn't sure if that made a difference
If you approve I will have Fran fill out the necessary blanks
Shelley I wanted to see if I could get the PAA in for Ava
If you approve then I will send to Fran to fill out the appropriate information
Effective immediately diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed regardless of your age from COMPANY contribution accounts
Can we get processed

Can we get them approved
Mauro it was very good to hear from you I just wish it would have been under different circumstances
I do appreicate your thoughtfulness

Lindy please connect me by conf
Teb please let Glen know if this day is ok for you
If you have questions please respond
With their extensive experience within the energy industry please keep them in mind if anything becomes available within ETS
Terry did we get Dave and Chris' second request done
If not maybe John could work on it
Chris Here is the information that you were requesting
Thought we could discuss on Friday
Assuming the historical data will support and demonstrate an operational need she is on board with this approach
She has my number if she needs further assistance
Please let me know if anything has been overlooked
Otherwise we will continue to work the issues above
I am available
Accordingly I need to reschedule my staff meeting
If any questions arise this weekend please feel free to contact me
I agree we need to put this posting out
What are your thoughts on this
I can see Dari's point
But I defer to Steve on this
Then it would not look like a discount
When they nominated as max rate overrun it got scheduled
Steve & Dari - what do you think
John what did you do with this
When I contacted UPS I discovered that UPS is resuming service with Enron today
If they need further clarification or have questions please give me a call
ENA can not transport the gas TW gives them
If you have any questions please let Rick or I know
Raetta can we do this same report for November
If you have any questions let Raetta or I know
Mike what projects do we have going on in the Business Objects report
Lynn This is how I view as my primary daily responsiblities
I think I covered them all
If I think of something else I'll advise
Just wanted to pass this on to you

Does that work for you guys
Do you know what this is about
If you could e-mail me and let me know what will work best for you I'd appreciate it
As soon as we hear from everyone I'll send out another e-mail to give the details
I would appreciate it
Mike sorry I am so late in sending this back
Looks great to me
Please provide your input & comments
Jerry Penny Steve and John you can use my office to make the call
If you have any questions give me call
If you have any questions don't hesitate to call
We will let you know if anything changes
Therefore after you repath the invoice we will still have a difference
I want to write-off whatever balance still exists after repathing
Please prepare the write-off documentation and I will sign
Will update as soon as I talk to him on Monday
We and our staffs are not allowed to communicate with them
Ava thanks for your quick reply
John and Terry can you work with the teams to get Shelley's name off of the daily update list
She is trying to minimize emails she gets on her blackberry
If you can think of any other lists let me know
I appreciate all your help
Joe I believe you were on comp day for commodity close
Just to let you know Shelley is trying to minimize emails she gets to preserve space on her Blackberry
I'm ok with it

Have you already sent your letter to Alliant
Thank you for staying with this
Please let me know if you have any other questions

So far we have not found an exceptable change
It is an item we are manually monitoring today but we are continuing to look for a better method
See you in January
I really appreciated it and your contributions to the meeting
You and your families all have a GREAT Holiday season
If we do not want that to happen we need to discuss our options
Yes we were successful in getting a transporter to step in
Jean work with Vernon on this it is up to him to negotiate the contracts
John After we spoke this afternoon I had another call from John Wollaston @ Embassy Natural Gas
Let me know how to proceed if this is a viable option
Do we want to set up a contract with Warrior Gas
ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy
I don't know the outcome of their conversation
I thought your group might be able to help him
I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him
Would you let me know if you plan to pursue
Will catch you on the next round
Thank you for considering me for the tickets
Debra I understand you were covering for Jean Adams while she was on vacation
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to give me a call

Sherry Did you get the fax
Does any of it makes sense

Many other shippers are also working hard to manage their business

We weren't trying to make an injection we were just trying to cut our withdrawal to zero

All of you have a great Thanksgiving with your families
I look forward to seeing you next Tuesday
You touched on everything we discussed
Debra thanks for your reply
However I did not have procedure for the allocation of estimated volumes
Tim and Mike would it be appropriate to have Mike call Bill and get specifics from him
Then we can do a conference call to explain the cuts
Lynn Tim I can't find a single date when LSP's overrun injections were cut completely
I really need more to go on
Please let me know what you find
I would like to respond to Bill as soon as possible
This report was a big hurdle for us
I will check with the team on how it is working
I walked the team through the login process refreshed and printed the report
I will do so at one of our earliest meetings
Please let me know if you have questions
Thank you so much for your invitation
I think it is a wonderful idea
I however will be unable to attend
I can go Monday but I can't Tuesday

I hope your Holidays were safe healthy and happy
A Merry Christmas wish to you and yours

On his collar coloring only a tramp would wear
Thanks Tami - I wish I could make it
Send my regrets to everyone
I have no idea what this means
Now we all want to move to Denver

I am soooo jealous
Do you already have the plans made
Call me or write me back
Sorry I missed the meeting

Are you talking about the retreat
And it is close to x-mas
I had a nice time at Bens party
Thank you for being you
I have received your E-Mail
I have received your e-mail
Thank you for your thoughts
Call me or write when you get thoses details
Looking forward to your visit
Sorry for the delay in getting back to you
Must be busy I havn't heard form you much
I am bored
It was great to get your note today
I also think of you often
It is sad actually ever since you left the group things have never been the same
Yes I would love to try and meet with you
I need more information though
So we are looking at drinks or dinner
She had mentioned that you wrote a note I guess I got the impression she had replied
I must tell you I miss you I don't have anyone to shake my head at anymore
Again I hope the job is treating you well
Thank you very much for the invite
My cousin sent me this
It is so stupid but it made me laugh
By the way the orthodontist called me last night
What is he thinking
I was not home thank goodness
I am not signed onto instant messenger
I am doing some research this morning
I am really nervous about my interview today
I think he's in the garage
Well help me land this Son of a Bitch
What should I do with it
That's what kind of fish it is
I'll clean it if you're so upset
Please watch your language
This was just too much for the Bishop and he ordered the Preacher to get rid of the animal
I am sure this is a joke but I dont get it.
How are things with you
Thanks for your note I always enjoy the reading
Thank you for doing this
I am in Kim
And --FYI I Dont do pictures
I dont know - what ideas do you have
Neither of them are foo foo ish people
Can I call you this evening on my way home
Or you going to be busy
What is your opinion
Thank you for your comments
Jeff I needed to apologize for my inability to handle myself in more of a professional manner
But that is my problem not yours
If you don't laugh at these you need a vacation
Just a note to say Hello and that I love you
I enjoyed yesterday afternoon
That meant alot to me more than you know
If you need more time to file your return you can easily get a filing extension
And if you can't afford to pay your tax bill now you can buy more time to pay up
You can now do it by phone computer or mail
If you're using tax-preparation software or a tax professional you can file your extension request by computer
What did you sell him
Then I sold him a larger fish hook
She has that bubbly personality just like her mom.
I look forward to seeing you guys again soon.
I am off for Atlanta first thing Monday morning.
That is why I am emailing you from home.
Remember when I instant messaged you
I have planned to come down for weeks.
As you know I take things to heart.
I hope I have done that.
Finally I just want to say that I will not bother you again.
With that I wish nothing but good things for you and your family
Please sign me up for a space in the new garage
You guys will never cease to amaze me
I don't remember who I used
Let me look and I will get back to you
Why would we
Hey - I just checked my E MAils for the day
I really am quite surprised
I believe your thinking correctly you need to seriously consider the Balitmore job
If so do you know when yet
Are her eyes blue or what
It has been nice getting reacquainted with you
I have no idea what you are referring to
I have a seperate system
I am in for the challenge and the long haul
Hopefully we can close ont he Highs
And I guess I need to understand why
Get a plan of action attack it and save this company
That is it
Please mark your calendars accordingly
Colleen I think you will find this very interesting
Why are you so cranky
Anything I can do
I wish I were more like this
Yes Susan sounds good to me
Thanks this gave me a nice chuckle this morning
I dont know how to reply - that is weird scary and sad
I have been trying to focus on helping Enron stay together
I am sorry if I am letting you down
I was only wanting to help
Now its stock is down wall street is be= arish and the CEO is gone
Almost preposterously fit they move through the buildin= g intently like winners
If you had a risky drilling venture E= nron would fund it for a piece of the action
Or could it
He almost missed his brother's wedding
He never once took his youn= gest son to school
Then his eyes lock on mine and his voice which had softened regains it= s pragmatic edge
His shrug stretches the lim= its of his shimmering blue button-down and his matching blue eyes look put= upon
Or as the saying goes you got to eat what you killed
I am glad your enjoying school so much I look forward to seeing you for the Holidays also
Tell everyone I said Hello
I look forward to seeing everyone at Thanksgiving I'll relay the message to Brad
Here are my notes
Did not yet have a chance to organize them so they're simply in chronological order
Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them
Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way
Doty adds that 'frankly' DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements
Do you remember Rob Lloyd
Wall Street had no idea of their holdings their leverage or their derivative exposures
Make no mistake they were cleverly contrived
But no clients ever complained to our knowledge
I thought you may appreciate this
You got any rotten tomatoes on your floor
I applaud you for your honesty
I have bought tamales to take to both homes
Please advise me if you received my package
I have already forwarded the information back to Enron
I was curious as to when I should be expecting the amended agreement could you confirm please
Yes I signed and returned the original one last week
Did you already sign
Thanks we are in bounds for the moment
I could stay a day or two if needed
This is fine by me
I can also include the London employees if you want
Hopefully we can make progress there also
Separately the scrap metals meeting we had with Causey went well
We will reconvene in two weeks to see where we are
Sounds fine to me
Also is the idea he would be a director sr director or vp
Each of these paths has consequences as you know
I liked him alot
I want to wish you the best of luck in EES
Again I hate to see you go but it will still be value added to RAC and Enron
I did not want this procrastinated on
Thanks for giving this your immediate attention
For your peace of mind
We will save this for our records
There was considerable discussion which I have summarized below
I answered positively which is what the capital price addresses
Maybe have her contact Ted since he is in London
Yeah I heard
I think I made the right decision ya think
I want to use it at our upcoming credit conference
I like this slide from Tara
Can we use somewhere
I guess the lesson is to not go away
Bill Bradford could attend in my absense if Dan thinks appropriate
Lets discuss this before we make offer
Are these numbers consistent with your expectations
I don't know if Skilling will do the same
I have a voice mail into him to see
I had heard that you were moving
Hopefully you are available to attend
If not please let me know
In hindsight it appears to be quite a good call
At the present we have no trades with either of these counterparties
I will look into London for your spring break
Send me the exact times you have off
OK by me
Only because I know Frank
Weird but ok by me
One final thought Michael is quite supportive of our effort and I think we should pick battles carefully
Sorry to hear your news
I'll talk to you in a day or two
Didn't mean it that way
I asked Dave Gorte if he saw anything negative in it he did not
So I don't think there is any issue here
I have no idea who sent me this message
It reminds me of the days with Enron
The people I met still asked me about Enron
Please join me in congratulating Ted David and Steve on their new assignments
I have two nominations for MD and one for VP
I'm worried we have more than initiative going on here
Mark- here is my response to your request
Doorstep was a huge effort involving RAC AA and operations to really understand where we have risks
Should we still pursue this
I know Jack is working on copper mines
Maybe you guts started without me getting involved
We need to understand what our exposure is
You need to become our India expert
Let's discuss if your numbers are different from these
Did you do it already
Where do we go from here
Would you like for me to arrange a meeting with Steve
Steve raises the issue of staffing in his email
I did not ask specifically about farmout agreements
I need to edit this
Keep moving it forward
If moving forward it will improve
Lets discuss when you have a minute
I hope we can get her
That will hurt us eventually
How do we include
Do you need hard copy of signature
I have already left him a voice mail
Will let you know when I hear
Don't build me a Rolls when a Chevy will do
Also please send Karen your own schedule
I am not sure I understand this
Can I still surf without going thru the Enron system
Can I still use AOL
Sounds like bs to me
Thank you for your time to discuss Perry Gas
Michael will represent us for both EES and ENA
Send him what was in books but no notes
Tell him it changes daily in a huge way
This boat far exceeds what I want
Thanks for the info though and keep me in mind
I approve this request
Harold and his family will leave for Boston in April
As you know a remaining issue involves who is responsible for these types of hedges Corp or business unit
The currency traders on Hickerson's desk contacted me today
This is a huge commitment of staff from RAC and will strain us no end but it is necessary
Let me know how to launch this program
Want to join us
Probably ok I guess
Do you think that's too pessimistic
How is your health
Is stress a big part of your life
Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort
Are you alive
Probably not any interest to you but you can decide
I can forward a brief outline if you'd prefer
For the larger groups your direct reports and key commercial and staff support should suffice
For the smaller groups a more complete list of your team would be appreciated
Let me know when you get this
I am getting the feeling that these messages don't get through
I see though there still is the sign off button on the bottom of the report
Is viewing it enough
I will attend in person
Most of our Board will be here in Houston
Are you feeling better
Same point as we discussed this am
I want to do this deal
What do you want to about this
I'm out of office til Wed Trip was good I presume
This is ok with me
They have requested it
Rick are you OK with this
Feel free to call me to discuss
Did you differ from me
Will let you know after that
Write me and let me know what is going on
See you later
Do you know who is familiar with this deal
Lets do what we can
I will try to set up a meeting tomorrow
If you have no issues I will proceed
Effective immediately I want to sign all Dashes for RAC
Thanks for your cooperation
As we discussed yesterday the exchange ratio adjusted price comparison is the key ratio to guage market merger appetite
I'll send it around from time to time
I can comment on trade behavior and margin if appropriate
Can you rough out a slide on rating agencies
Let me know if it meets your needs
I will modify it any way your heart desires
Does this impact our discussion of yesterday
By the way Richard Sanders was very helpful in helping me deal with this
I will forward to you a copy of the Complaint
If you wish to have separate representation please let me know
Please do not hesitate to call me with any questions
Bill- I have revised presentation
Do you want to see it again
Greg- we plan to counter at indicated discount
Did you send out a global message from me
I have received many replies that message is undeliverable
Suggest you get facts before judging anyone
Please send me an email
Obviously some stakeholders would do better that others but that's the way it goes sometimes
This is what you are talking about
Do I want to be represented by someone named lawless
Janet - thanks for your note
Following are my thoughts
First I am not going to Netco
Second I have spoken with Ken Lay and Jeff McMahon about the continuation of RAC and my leading it
I hope this addresses your issue
Hope your holding up
Unfortunately I will be talking with the SEC next week
Can you make this happen rapidly
They are very nice and are expecting you and Rebecca
Feel free to ask them for advice help or whatever
If something happens and you need money I'll pay Ted back
You should publish it in business week or fortune
Thanks for sending me a copy
Call me for great news
Here's my info
Also remind me to give you my tax return info
Noel forwarded it to me yesterday as it got sent back from the Rushing River address
I would also appreciate a receipt notification from this e-mail as it contains very important information
Haha do I sound official enough
I think that's about it
Please let me know if you have any objections or conflicts and I'll confirm or reschedule as appropriate
I like this
Is it a fraternity or sorority
See what you think when you get a second
Let me know if you have questions or comments
Stephanie- can you fax this guy a blank dash
The names on this list seem very expensive to me
Do we really need this council
Unfortunately you just can't keep Frevert waiting especially when he wants to have a beer
Lets catch up when you are in Houston
Have Suttle call her also
I am committed to staying at Enron
Many thanks for your consideration
Bill Bradford and/or John Suttle will be contacting you
Tim- Thanks for your note
Before Janet D left she had requested additional resources and we began making arrangements to get people in place
Tracy is one of our best people
Also does being in Houston work or do we need resources in Portland
As you know we believe existing personnel is top notch There just aren't enough of them
The quality of work we get from Tracy Ed Wendy and Paul is nothing less than phenomenal
It seems to us that additional resources are warranted
I guess he didn't
I'll leave him a message
Here is an application for George when he retires
Maybe we could have them rotate to another group in RAC
Mr Bradford I just wanted to reiterate my interest in a RAC rotation following our conversation last week
Many thanks once again for your assistance
He could even chair it if he was up to it
I may need a job
Hope all is well on your end
I am sure that is another side to it
Hope things are going OK for you
Otherwise could you suggest some time
I didn't realize everything was here
Lets set a date and get after it
However you provided a far more global perspective including the view senior management the Board and the investment community
Cassandra David or me
Do you guys think these meetings are still necessary
Even as we move away from these investments there may be some additional lessons to be learned
Does our post-audit process and procedure continue
I left Skilling a message on this
Lets see what he has to say
Therefore we will move ahead with this
The local loop is off-net so I would imagine that you will want some protection on that side
Let me know if you need anything else from me
In addition we are in the process of developing a model to identify the various decision inflection points
I have no personal transactions with any Enron entity
We can help you interview
This meeting is in early May so after mid April it starts to get crazy
Rick I think what would work best is a half to full day in Houston
In fact I have a few candidates cueing up
I was thinking David Port
I had dinner with Marc Tarkington on Wednesday
He sends his best regards to you
Please let me know if this additional information would be meaningful
Are you making any progress on the credit side
The economy has hurt us
To hear trucking industry leaders tell it get comfortable with beans and franks for dinner
But the worsening economy has made that rebuilding job harder he said
However it still indicates a contracting manufacturing sector
Thank-you for your prompt response
Thanks for your E-mail message
Thank you for choosing Cummins power
What else would you need from us
I would be happy to do so but my feelings won't be bruised if you think it unnecessary
Are you ok with this arrangement
Do you guys agree
You can't run a portfolio model unless you have deals in a risk system
How complex do we want these MODELS to be
Vince & Bill - if you want to join the meeting please let me or Anita know
I have run the model and along with the contract briefs I have some questions & ideas
I plan to do that went I get back
I would expect this is done already
That is the credit implications of companies changing their credit rating during the contract period
The contract briefs are to me the begimnning of this exercise
I will provide the call-in number
I think they will get the point
Attached is the list Karen gave me for the PRC members
Can we shorten
If not I guess it is ok it will just take longer and be harder to reach consensus
Are we working on this already
Please make yourself available for this
Please notify the attendees in your group
It's been a long time since we talked but I trust that things are well with you and Lea
Sorry for the out-of-the blue email but I look forward to catching up with you in the future
Recall that Jeff had several requests when we met with him
I asked you to write them down
Have we done all of them
Can you give me an update
Why are we paying someone to do this
I asked my guys to check if we had seen deal
I will get Karen to set up
Time sensitive so we need in next couple days
If they are not legally obligated little if any value
Even better if we can assign the contract itself as security
Is it capped
This is my quick cheat sheet of items I screen for
Thank you for inviting us to the happy hour yesterday
I also want to thank Karen Heathman and Rita Hennessy
Be happy to spend some time with them
Thanks for your continued understanding
Rick attached is the cover letter and resume I promised you
Blaise- I have distributed your resume internally to a couple places
Will let you know if anything pops
Since you are in charge of career development- I want to be President soon=
Let me know if this would be = valuable for you
This Pro= gram has been and will continue to be our most important source of new tal= ent
I will think about it
Get Brown involved to make sure we get those guys
Use Ene options as a currency to entice them
I need to talk to you about where this is going
Ted my comments are indicated below
There was absolutely no on going recruiting effort here therefore I have to start from scratch
You have failed to build consensus in your credit initiative
If people aren't satisfied for the right reasons they should leave
Finally I am trouble finding my own motivation
I don't particularly care what it does for Ted Murphy
David- can you get w/ Sharon Sullo and provide this
As with muni bonds it is nice to be able to just raise taxes to cover your costs
However as we've seen lately with all of the turmoil in CA their perspectives have changed
In this instance my client is a major player in commodity-related risk management products
Can you help here
Rick Rick Ted Murphy is chasing me up for answers on his corp allocations
I will look into this
Rick do I really need to do this on an on-going basis
Can we discuss this
Rick Rick do I really need to do this on an on-going basis
No I already told her there was no interest at Enron
I think I'll decline unless it gets her off your back
I hate to ask you to make yet another trip
However there is probably nothing more important right now given markets view of us as a trading company
Let me check w/ Despain on pulse here
Get back to you
Rick do you want me to participate in this meeting
Andy- I will be out of office until friday
Please let me know if you are interested in attending
Port Bradford you and I will attend from RAC
Rick I have no problem making the trip
I don't think there is much else that as important
David Port should be contacting you shortly
I would like to make the temperary VAR permanent
I would give most to gas and some to power
Were we involved in transaction
Did we run any numbers
Were we at the meeting with Skilling
I will send that to you when I have it
RAC did not prepare its own numbers
As you know Enron Japan has made the move from Power to Global Markets
I will follow-up on this issue but for now protection is unclear
I will also make sure the right systems are in place to capture transactions volumes etc
I will keep everyone posted on their progress
I can meet wed pm
I am planning on being out all week
I will call in
I assume you will provide a number
Is this who you were going to consult for
Many thanks for your role in yesterday's meeting with Borden Chemical
If we do not hear back from Bob by mid-next week I will call him
If you approve as written please let us know
Give me a call next week if you can
We are ready when you are
I particularly like the click button to RSVP - very clever
I am happy to discuss if you would like
Dave- we can act as a check on this
Please advise your business units if appropriate of this procedure
Send it out
Just between you and I I think there may be an issue here of a couple personalities
We can't have that in your group or mine
On the subject of timing we should probably have a standard to shoot for
Please help me on this
Will you take a stab at this w/ Hughes
Rick Michael - can you confirm it is needed
Am I missing something
Although yesterday's meeting was excellent we do need to get a lot more detailed on the Re-start plans
So far we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors
Michael - can you confirm it is needed
I have attached below some press releases related to the issue
I would like to attend this as well
For now I am most concerned about the current portfolio
I appreciate your help in these matters
To respond to this interest we would like to conduct a survey which addresses these goals
We have prepared a proposal which outlines our approach for conducting a survey and provides samples of expected output
I look forward to speaking with you and potentially working with you as a participant in this project
So please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel
Please communicate this policy to your staff
Can't delegate it
I will be available
Should I coordinate with Janet Dietrich
Rick The reports I am getting regarding you are quite encouraging
Hope you continue to make progress without too much pain
Don't talk unless you have to
Could you imagine if I ever have that operation there'd be blood everywhere
Not that people aren't working on stuff but your perspective is needed
I have spoken to Steve
He hasn't told me his final decision
Finally we are starting to see some reasonable quality - a little more expensive but much better
I recall our conversation
Please call if you wish to discuss
Rick Sorry about your setback
I want to reassure you that everything is under control here
If there is anything else that you are concerned about I will be more that glad to tackle it
How do we do that
At least you know you are out of control
Your guys need you
I hope this is consistent with your understanding
John Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions
Maybe we need to rethink entire process
Did this lady contact you
Please let me know at your earliest convenience
Thank you in advance for volunteering your time
I didn't see where she said it was mismarked
Stick to your guns going forward
FYI - I could suggest she has mine
Am I the only RAC VP w/o an office
Did we run out of space
He is thinking about it
Also David you might want to discuss w/Whalley beforehand
But I think this is clearly contrary to how Ted Legal etc
So what are we willing to do to compromise if anything
For instance a person would declare where their personal brokerage accounts are held and statements are reviewed
Have all such access disconnected if you find it connected
I will keep you apprised as things develop especially if thing accelerate in the next few days

I met with Michael Levy also
Are they connected
I will let you know the time and place
It does not sound like this lady has her act together
I wish I knew more about biomedical engineers
Don't worry at all about your resume right now it is almost irrelevant
The lady was very helpful but sort of scared me
But she said I'm lucky that I came in so early.
I also applied for engineering dean's host today
But I may not get it so oh well
She says she has a headache
I accept cash or check
I will try to have some fun this weekend
OK that's it for now
HOpe all's well for you
If you need a proof to approve please reply to this message and confirm a fax number for us
Thank you for you time
Generally I believe he has done a good job
Ted- Did you do David's performance review
Marianne - per my voicemail
Fundamentally it is in the best interest of the= market to allow customers to come and go
EWS has not set it itself up to monitor such requirements
Therefore I ca= nnot comment on the accuracy or details of this requirement
However it i= s something we definitely need to look into
Do we already have industrial customers in our por= tfolio
This whole thing is beyond my imaginations ability to comprehend
This sounds terrific to me
My wife Janice likes boating as well but neither of us owns an ascot
I can't believe you finally got Vlady
You must have snuck in while I was on vacation
Lets see how it works
Also do they ask is it can be reduced because of portfolio effect
Now that Raptor is blown up should we begin valuation efforts of assets and include in merchant portfolio

Ron will you take the lead in making sure we have a smooth transition on this
Thanks Now that Raptor is blown up should we begin valuation efforts of assets and include in merchant portfolio

Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group
Given me a call if you have any questions
I recommend David Port for position of Vice President
Rick - I intend to go to this but it seems strange that David can't
Can you make an exception
Seems like he should
After all it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times
I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting

As per our discussion the first step was to identify the participants in the retention program

For the first time it shows an incredibly disturbing number related to imputed income
I have fixed our slide

Therefore we need a new DASH and a quick summary of transaction which would include changes from original deal
I have scheduled a meeting to discuss
We are looking forward to working with you and your staff
Kevin given the track record of mis-behaviour I don't fault you with the = premise of guilt before understanding
Instead we took it public and let it run a= mok
I think you can see parallels across the company
Do with as you will
I have to say we are so dispointed with Enron
Koch-generally no crude and products but they have traded some small weather products
Sempra is looking at their exposure to us in physical products and asking questions about our docs
ICE--The Majors have cut us off
Joe - should I get some lunch ordered
We need to talk today on what we say to ctpies
Others are slowly restricting us in various ways
Glad it was worthwhile for you
Something went wrong and it never got delivered
I still want you and Karen to read it
Thank you for inviting us to the Happy Hour last week
I would like to keep straight who I have spoken with
The only card I received is from Michael Geffroy

Do you think they are getting the message
Please call me with comments or questions
Keep me in mind in the future
Please let me know if you'd like to go
Hope your not biting your tongue again
Hi Jule- thought about your comment about Fidelity
Call them and tell them to get that stuff to you
You should carefully manage your money
Lots of our efforts in the past building systems procedures and infrastructure pay off in times like these
Things are not back to normal but they are improving
Upon receipt of commitment from banks hopefully later today or early tomorrow our short term issues should be resolved
Bill should have copied you
I look forward to hearing from you shortly
Are you available that date
Let me know and I will arrange a time so that we can sit in
I hope the bank deal comes through quickly
I wonder which beach AF is on right now
I imagine AF is not enjoying any beach right now
Beleive it or not everyone in the industry I talk with is pulling for Enron
Thought you might like the attachment
Go for it
He said he will issue an approval for such a request
The pig came out with a big chunk out of it
We had to haul it out a pail at a time
These two runs took us nine hours to run that is why we only did two
Only most of it
In Arizona we do not have a blanket approval for discharges of hydrostatic testwater
However it is conceivable that the site was cleared prior to initial construction and the trees simply grew back
Unfortunately I don't have that information and don't know if you do either
Otherwise we will have to obtain the necessary information and that's beyond our initial scope
If you have had any biological reports done for the area on other projects that may provide enough information
Again it only needs to be brief
After you have had a chance to think about this please call and we can discuss
Again I apologize the inconsistency in the data
I hope this information will help in the permit review process
Again please accept my apologizes in the data collection errors
Please confirm this and let me know
I have asked that two reports be prepared for each site
I'll keep you posted on how things progress
My question is do you have such a facility in your team area and what does it comprise
I just received the letter today
Kermit Team I really need your assistance on this
I received a notice from the TNRCC about the above facility
In light of this does this facility exist in your area of responsibility
Alison have you found out anything about the above referenced
I have spoken to Bill about this
I beleive that EOTT is responsible for paying the fee
I didn't forget about you
Would you like a copy of what I found
I would appreciate your immediate attention in this matter
James - did you get letter
I have also attached data provided to other bidders
Arnold I have attached a spreadsheet showing what information I need to complete the air permit applications
If so is it possible for you to get a fax
If so I could fax over to you a template of what information I need
If not Ill give you a list of the engine parameters
As Scott's server is down Ill phone him and have him send you the action item list
Sorry I have not responded sooner but I've been tied up with the crude lines transaction
I sent Koch a letter in December requesting they undertake it
Lorraine Ill give you a call this afternoon
By the way did they test the liquids for PCBs
Rick can youcheck on this for me
Please call me to discuss
And if it works the money would have been wisely used
Michael I know its been some time since we communicated but how is the PCB pipeline modeling efforts going
Have you thawed out from the Pennsylvania winter
If no liquids are present drop Lorraine and or myself a message stating such
I hope this helps out
When I came back on friday I completed the matrix and sent it back to the team
Any delays on this issue are from the team not from me
Please respond to me only
Again I did not evaluate the mercury or the loading rack issues
Think its white wall and roof with blue trim
Michael I will be discussing with John and others in the near future about the status of the study
When will your progress report be ready for review
Thanks for getting back with me
I have just got back from an overseas trip yesterday
I was also waiting for input from your group
Please let me know of any thoughts and ideas
I think this meeting will be very interesting and informative and and encourage all to attend if possible
Randy I need your assistance with something
Whatever you have I would greatly appreciate your shaing it with me
E mail works best for me
The new CEO will be a person named Ron Marcoux and I will be speaking with him next week

HOld off on the tree cutting till we hear from the state of Arizona
Once the trees are cut Ken will send me the Tree Contract and invoice for those trees
Again I would be happy to make the contacts for you
My question is now what are our next steps
I am building a work order authorization for some minimal dollars to get things like the ROW EIS etc
Assuming we have necessary market support what would it cost to move to the next level on the EIS
What do we get for our money
Larry per our phone conversation tonight
I found this article interesting especially in light of potential future expansions on TW
Before it supplanted our funding now it will supplement it
Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with that assessment
You can throw around percentages any way you want
You can take that non-support as far as you like
I have not heard from Bill Olson of the OCD yet
Ill let you know when I hear from the OCD
Heres the way it is
He advised me not to do this
Two weeks ago I spoke at a pipelines conference in New Orleans on this issue
We could help if you have any problems
Questions let me know
Bret this is a question from someone in my office
Don't forget to take your camera
As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates we will need to develop some preliminary maps
I know there is more but this will help to keep some of the early events coordinated
Ill keep you apprised of this issue
This way I wont step on any toes
John I look forward to you being there hopefully for both days
I plan on coming for at least a day
They strongly suggested that I contact the compliance group before contacting Nancy Wrona Director of the ADEQ
Either Bill Kendrick or I will be touching base with her again tomorrow
In all monthly calls both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule
After your review we can make the necessary changes and modifications
Thanks for your patience in this
Should we schedule this and if so who will be attending in Sarah's place
Would you please check on the status of this expense report
Kay the choice is yours as to how you want to clean your oil staining
Is this something we should look at doing

First issue that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ
Again thanks for your work and effort that you have put in on this project
Rich whats your thoughts on a decent pipeline segment for the modeling study
I kind of like Sta
Frankly if you want your permits ASAP there really isn't time for that
John in response to you questions below im da man
You should probably circulate the draft to Pribble after you are comfortable with it to get his preliminary buy-in
Now I do have a few questions
Please feel free to comment the second page are notes from our meeting with assignments
I plan on being there
We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel monitoring schedule they wanted us to do wet chemistry
By having the permit but not constructing we will be OK
John I agree with your points
If not we should put the proper spin on it which in my opinion should come from Marketing
Shudeish said he would check and get back to me
Please let me know if you have any thoughts or comments
The choice is yours
Stoney Let me know what I can do to help
Larry you need to direct this to them also they dont seem to be to worried

What does he want me to do with it
Have him call me
Could you please forward this to Susan Fick
I don't have her e-mail
Bret what do you think about this
Gradients plume elevations and characteristics of the contaminants show that this is not our problem
Apply the storage gas only to our storage customers
As a security procedure for the NYISO and our customers we verify each applicant with our contact list
Our list for your organization does not include this name
We appreciate your assistance in this matter
Marlene please call me if this is not correct
Can you help Sherry with this set-up
Please let me know if serving this site is a problem

To your right is Holyoke Mall
One additional note apparently PG&E has discovered PCBs in their gas compressors
Audrey can set the meeting up for you
Even with this they were pretty insistent that their management wanted the facility cleaned
If they are successful with this action the pipeline system will be next
Their pipeline is not piggable and to make it such would require replacement of pipe valves etc
Michael our liquids data collections have been pretty lean
We will follow up when we return

I have attached my PCB file to this memo for review
Larry can you give a hand with this
I've shown the story to Bill and he suggested that you let Rich Jolly know about the story

A couple of things I want to bring out
First we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the Lagunas in the near future
Please get back with me on this
The data showed fuel savings as we had hoped it would and we also received an emissions reduction benefit
Larry Campbell suggested that we try to remedy this through Solar Turbines first before we pursue other avenues
Let us know if we can help in any way
I will keep everyone updated
I will provide the drawing permit and permit requirements when we receive them
Once we secure all these permits and schedule work we will provide copies to you
What would it hurt to ask her
Do you want me to ask her about this
Larry Does this meet with your understanding of what Randi is doing
Are we all on the same page
I will inform you when I receive the draft report
After that meeting I will decide who should do the applications

Ill keep you in prayer
Larry I have been thinking of you a lot with all of the Enron stuff going on
Keep me posted on how things are going with you
I will be praying for you

I will keep my ears open for any employment opportuni= ties
When you're feeling down and discouraged drop me a line

Bottom line you need to keep this permit at each location
I am looking forward to putting the model into motion
No problem with signing the no cost extension for the project send it my way
Dear Larry It was good hearing from you a few days ago

Is there something wrong with your phone

If you release an escapee do not acknowledge it
Pretend it did not happen
If you are standing next to the farter at the urinal pretend that you did not hearit
No one likes an escapee it is uncomfortable for all involved
As with all farts it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist
OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER Definition A colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it
SAFE HAVEN Definition A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors
This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact
CAMO-COUGH Definition A phony cough which alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall
ASTAIRE Definition A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential TURD BURGLARS that you are occupying a stall
If you hear an ASTAIRE leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace
If you feel a WATERMELON coming on create a diversion

I wonder why you didn't get it
Thanks for getting it typed into the system
I look forward to reviewing the document
In fact I am thinking that we should have anyone who works in HR sign off on this agreement
It should go in PH file with a copy to me for my files
I have prepared a contractor agreement which Derek Anderson has
If you need a copy let me know
With so many contractors working in HR I believe we need to also include them in this exercise
Thanks for your response
Otherwise I believe that we are ready to review a final version of the plan
Jeanne could you please circulate one
Once corporate comp gives it the ok we should be ready to finalize it
I hope this is better late than never
Marissa Womble forwarded the edited procedure to me and I will make the necessary changes to the document
I truly appreciate your knowledge and legal expertise especially in this matter
Elspeth do we want to do a new agreement or simply assume the obligations in the old one
It also depends on the language in the old one and whether we believe it protects ENA
So we'd have to look at it
Sharon do you have the file on this person
If so let me know and I will have someone come and pick it up
I expect that Jon will be calling me any day

I would appreciate the opportunity to review them
Rick are you on this or should I get on it
Do you have a copy of that agreement
I am copying Michelle and Rick since they may have been involved in the earlier matter
As is typically the case we can't seem to find a copy
Can you help out
I have reviewed the additional fields you described

Is there a less intrusive way to ask it
If you would like to discuss this further please give me a call

Thanks again for your help
I am not comfortable with bringing someone in without an agreement

Also how many candidates are you looking to bring on
If so I would appreciate your getting me in the loop as early as possible
Let me bug them again early next week
I will provide you with a transcript upon receipt
Additionally counsel for Clonch continues to call me and write me letters for Deposition dates for Enron officials
FYI I just learned that Jeff Golden is going to work for EES
Twanda I will have inserts to the two agreements for Bryce Baxter from this document
Please let me know if you change it
I will need to have it executed
I am aware that an agreement was contemplated
I did not prepare one however
I worked only on the employment agreement
If we need to put one in place it can be done rather easily
Right now I am
Thanks for your help on this
If you approve I will file these tomorrow and bring this matter to a conclusion
Thanks for you attention
Here is the thing I have edited
Michelle as you will recall you helped us with the statement for HR-GIS
Thank you for your consideration and help
I am not surprised by this outcome
I guess wer're bargaining
I tried to reach each of you by phone this afternoon
Twanda would you please print this and attachment
We are asking them to forward this file to you as we discussed to assist you with data collection
Thanks again Felecia for your help
I got this email
Twanda would you please print this and also the attachment -- with the notes
I am meeting with him today
From my understanding he agrees with the attached so we can move forward with the payback letter
Can you assist
I agree but there is still no policy in place
Yes I probably am the person to contact on this
Look for it in the next few days
At the end of my message to Christopher please see the list of countries that we need information about
Very good to hear from you after all this time
In the meantime I hope you have a good weekend
Please let me know if this time is not convenient and we will arrange for another call
I hope you are well and look forward to our work together
I was out on vacation last week so I only gave Kim my feedback early this week
I hope that ELM has received the response by now
Let me know if I need to do anything else
Let me know if you don't receive it by next Wednesday
Don't worry about it
Of all people I understand about schedules being tight
I will call you this weekdend
I am a little keyed up
I believe that Cline has different counsel now and I will find out about this asap
If he calls back tell him to speak with Alan
I don't know anything about this
Let me know if that is the case
I think that makes it worse

Let me know when you think you might have it
I believe that there is a possibility of litigation
He and I are meeting this week to discuss opportunities
What is the status of our discussions with Carlos
Please feel free to talk with him
I do think well of Carlos and certainly believe that he is a lawyer that Enron wants to keep
I am sending you a copy of the opinion which I got from the Daily Labor Report
Once it did the burden shifted back to Reeves to show that the stated reason was false
Beth do you really need me there
I haven't been involved in KAFUS at all
Pursuant to your request I have revised the Disclaimer below
I think it would be neat to hear from George Bush or George W Bush
Or is there someone at Enron you think we have overlooked thus far
Twanda would you please handle this
If you have any questions about this letter or this topic in general please let me know
Felecia forwarded the voicemail to me from Melissa Laing
Attached is my draft of what we discussed
Why do they want this information
Pursuant to my voicemail I am forwarding the attached e-mail traffic for your consideration
I assume you are the appropriate lawyer for Mexico
I recently joined the Enron Corp legal staff from Enron International legal

Thank you so much for your assistance
If you should have any questions please feel free to contact me
Where are we with regard to the investigation into this matter
In our meeting on Friday we talked about the summary of complaints that you three are going to do
If possible I would like to receive those by Tuesday night so that they can be reviewed on Wednesday
This works for me
I agree that we should convene and discuss
I would be surprised if we have grounds to challenge but we can keep our fingers crossed
If we don't then we could discuss strategy for negotiations
I think this is a good idea Is it ok with you
Dale here it is
Are you planning to be gone then too
I hope you are having fun and not working too hard
Don't worry too much about me
I do miss you though
I really appreciate all the support that ya'll are providing

I am available in the afternoon tomorrow
Please call my assistant Twanda Sweet to confirm a time
I am available any time tomorrow
Feel free to pass it along
Trey Unfortunately I do not know of any position at Enron that would be available
Based upon her voice mail message there is a strong possibility of litigation
Once you have conducted the investigation please provide me with the results
Last night I asked Trey about it and we went onto Amazon.com to look at it
But we can wait til Christmas so go ahead with your plans
Check it out when you go to the toy store
Let me know if you need help with the script
Trey would you please print this for me at home
If you have questions about the form please call Kriste Sullivan at the number below
If you have any questions I can be reached at the number below
I left you a voice mail yesterday but I wasn't sure if you were in
Let me know if I should be contacting someone else
I had a blast with you being here
We watched How the Grinch Stole Christmas today on the Cartoon Network and he was happy as can be
I believe it was the old diversity program
Molly Do you have some sort of policy about hiring lawyers
We have received a resume but didn't know if anyone in Legal would be interested in seeing it
Lexi I don't think the legal department takes candidates without prior legal experience
Molly will you check with Kriste or Sharon on their policy so that we know for the future
Give me a copy of his resume
I have attached one of their sample contracts for your review
Lloyd Sorry it was our e-mail system
Pam I spoke with Rex through several voice mails early this week
I expect that it has been signed already
I never heard back from Rex
Twanda what do we need to do with this information
How do we get Emma paid
Pat here is additional information about the transaction we have been working on
Of course they are going to finalize tomorrow
I agree with your concerns about the tortious interference situation
Do you have any suggestions on mitigating that risk
Generally speaking nothing has changed since we last spoke
If California then he needs a slightly different agreement because non-competes are not enforceable in California
I hope these help
Let me know if you would like additional information
I think there may be others as well
He's meeting with me on Friday
If you have an interest in talking with him let me know and I will arrange a meeting
Please keep me in the loop
Otherwise I can schedule it a few weeks from now
As of now does this date still work for you
I'll get back with you if it doesn't
I hope that this date still works for you
Let me know if you would like to discuss this issue
Twanda could you please print for my review
Do you have any information on that
The plans should either have this amount immediately available or be able to calculate this amount for you
If you would like us to assist you with obtaining this information please let us know
If any of these actions have been assigned to another responsible party please let us know
If you have any questions or concerns please let us know
Also please let us know if you prefer this document in Word format
However if it is your recommendation that we have to honor those letters so be it
The RW employees may or may not be ours
Based upon my brief review of her comments many are not acceptable
Dee what do you think
I suggest that we let them handle that but defer to your opinion
I will let her make that call
FYI here is information relating to the voice mail I forwarded to you late Friday
I will distribute the information memorandum at Monday's meeting
I apologize for the short notice but look forward to working with you all on this transaction
We are looking at other options and I am confident that we will be back with another partner
Thanks for your time and help in this process
I would love to attend except that I will be out of the office on vacation that whole week
Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon Purswell
TWanda I assume that you have these saved somewhere
If not would you
Debi I will prepare a draft response for you
First off I am wondering how you knew the company name I was calling on
I never gave that other girl the name of the company
Any how I am wanting information on Contracting Solutions Inc
How was their performance
Are you currently doing business with them
Maybe we can find an alternative
Do we ever do fixed term offers
I know we can do it in the UK just not sure about the US
I agree with your approach
PS I am out next week on vacation
Call Twanda to arrange for assistance while I am out and she will refer you on
Are you comfortable with that
Also I am in tomorrow but then am out all next week on vacation
While I am out you can work with Emma Caplan
Keep these names and I'll keep you posted on who to schedule with him
Could you arrange
This is when we started these discussions
Your plan sounds good to me
What is the harm in accepting them
Are we obligated to interview the candidate
Let me know if my assumption is not correct
Also I am not sure your apology is necessary
There is only one John Nguyen that works for Enron and he is at EBS
We got no response from Keith which for him is considered a no
He was directly recruited by Ergos presented by them and hired through them
Neither Jen nor I have asked them for this yet
Here are my recommendations - please give me your thoughts
They should contact me directly at that time
We are looking forward to our trip
I look forward to seeing you Mary Lou and Peter if available
If they don't show up at the appropriate time tomorrow give me a call and we'll track them down
I am not really familiar with the specific facts here
So let's try to discuss it
Michelle can you help us with this one
I have today spoken to Ed Dablin regarding Henry Bath LA
We discussed how the employees seem to feel that they are Enron employees although they are infact agency workers
However this is his ideal scenario
How viable is it that we can do this for him
Wednesday will be a travel day and we will spend Thursday and Friday at the Port Angeles data room
Attached please find a list of employees we plan to interview
That way we aren't making it an absolute ban
They almost need to be coached all the time unless they are really good which is rare
This is why we are going to a preferred vendor list
That would certainly make me not want to work with them
I'm fine with letting go of it
This has been a good learning experience for me
I certainly agree with the concept
It sounds like it gives us more flexibility
Hope things are going well with you and yours
I suggest doing it in writing rather than an email that could be manipulated
If you have theri fax number that probably would be best
We prefer to keep our vendor list private
It is not our practice to provide references for contracting agencies
I am sure that Contracting Solutions can provide you with alternatives
By the way I spoke with Jennifer Cronin who had referred your call to me
I have reviewed the attached
I think it looks good
Alan he's out of town until Friday so I will schedule early next week with you and Dan
Others are interested as well so we'll probably have a full interview schedule with him
Randy's email made it sound like there was one
I appreciate your feedback ASAP
Does this work for you
But I will let Melissa address the question
Hello I hope all is well with you
I will be keep you apprised of the status
Thank you for your assistance in this matter
Thanks for letting them know about my contact
I emailed them the form so we should be on our way
David I did not receive the package in interoffice mail
Did you receive my interoffice mail
She is on the phone with you now regarding this attachment
Pat Mackin requested that I forward this on to you
Pat do you still have a copy of the one you prepared a while back
Therefore we have decided to have a NO Excuses Girls Night
What do you think about that
If you are interested let me know
Any modifications based upon your team's comments should not be difficult
If I receive additional feedback I will let you know
Rick It sounds like this may satisfy CURE but I question whether this is an appropriate payment
Hoyt -- actually we need only the New York office -- other locations should not be included
I have instructed Paul Blundy the attorney contact for our Canadian counsel to have documents sent to Rick
Rick as you receive data that involves benefits please send it to Dee
If Stacey can do it so can I
I hope all is well with everyone
Brian and I were talking about the dissemination of this policy
Please provide me with any questions or comments on this policy
Please see the note below which was forwarded to me by Richard Sanders on Triple Lutz
CPage Would you please forward this directly to Pat
If you are available on Friday I would like to have a phone introduction of you and Hoyt
Twanda would you please set this up when Pat calls
I don't think we need a certification
Brian what do you think
Twanda would you please set up this meeting for me
Molly add her to the list for Carlos
I am interested in Carlos
I would also like to run some references on Bonnie Nelson
Ginger I cannot attend that meeting as I am in another
So count me in
Let's capture the good available to us in innovation
I too would like to be involved in this discussion
How would you like to approach this
Would you facilitate this discussion
Give me a small number of loose grades anytime
I will be out of the office on Wed-Friday on business
In the meantime you can meet with David/Robert and begin to look at revamping our prior efforts
Alternatively you can reconvene the group and work on revising action plans without me
PS do we need to include Don in our group

Please review this draft to determine if it fits your needs
Bill I had asked Twanda to get a conference call with you and Dana Davis on Williams
I would like to have a petition ready early next week

I cannot overstate the importance of the schedules
Thanks for your continued efforts
Alice for the employee we discussed last week here is information on payee

Please make sure that happens or our waivers will not be valid

Please feel free to share this with your management
The number of employment agreements seems low to me particularly in trading
EIM Ray Bowen has asked Julia and I to provide training to the Industrials Group
No two situations are alike and they require significant time
Generally I review those before they are put in place
I expect to see a great emphasis on hiring
For your information
Would you like a copy of it
Please let me know if you hear from Shonnie or Steve
I agree this seems very sensible to me
He mentioned to me that Tony's primary concern is the nonsolicitation
Michelle what are your thoughts

With regard to the claims what is your opinion
Let me know what your thoughts are
The letter I received today from his attorney answers my questions
I'll fax over to all of you
I suggest running it by the HR leadership team
I really appreciate your help
I actually spoke with Ted today about you
He is working on scheduling you for a meeting but he has had some difficulty in finalizing schedules
So there is no need to follow up because he will get with you in a few days
Can you forward his email address
Would you please re-send me the Employee Matters Agreement for Lutz
I am not aware of any change to that structure

Do we have an answer on Cirino
So I told her to call you
I am not at all surprised
Feel free to call Kerry directly about his availability

I was aware of that joyous news

Could you get with Twanda to do that

I would question whether the mill has had harassment prevention training and if so when

I have reviewed the documents in the data room and I have the following thoughts
Laura do you need any more information from me on this point
First am I correct
Second have we ever done random testing in this type of situation
Sounds like they have a precedence for doing it
However I have worked in a DOT environment and understand the desire to test them all
I don't think it is good practice
We need to get our staff into the Enron internal program
Not everyone in my group is effected but most are
If you need furhter information please do not hesitate to ask
Felicia Does this sound right to you
In addition we do not feel that we are subject to an OFCCP audit
Pat thanks for your comments
I do have one observation about the call
I heard nothing like that in the conference call yesterday

When did we learn of that setting

Kathy I think we should do some sort of an assignment agreement
I have a hair appointment Saturday which I cannot really change this late in the year
So do you want to get a haircut manicure or anything else beautifying while you are here
If so I'll book something for you
There is no way we would have you babysit
In fact we have a sitter for Saturday night
I can't wait for your visit
I don't want to cramp your anniversary celebration
I received and reviewed your email and I will check with my clients on your proposal
I expect that I will have an answer later this week
Let me know if you did not receive them
Feel free to give me a call to discuss
See you then
Go ahead and file it
And more importantly when can we reschedule lunch
I met with David Baumbaugh today about Bridgeline
Apparently we have sent Trey Logan over there to replace O'Neal Winfree
For example are you working on deals that require you to be out of town
George I know we talked about your scheduled international travel
Yes we will reword it
In fact we are looking at a review of the entire application
Wednesday is her last day
If not would you please forward me her resume again
I raised that proposal with Nancy who is going to discuss it with her business clients
I'll let you know as soon as we do
I would suggest that we remain vague about the whole thing until the deal if it happens is signed
Michelle or Fran Could you please clarify this point for Pat and his group
You should have it
I sent it yesterday
Twanda could you confirm
She was just wondering where we stand with it
We appreciate your help in answering this question for us
Does this give you enough information
Maybe you know the answer
It seems to me that this is a clean set up
My goal is to minimize our exposure on the front end
I think this looks good
I think the last sentence speaks for itself
Otherwise it is good to go
I am out of the office today so please send any changes via my interoffice email
Again it was a pleasure meeting you yesterday and I appreciate all of your guidance concerning this matter
Can you believe all that is going on in Sunny Florida

I spoke with Dean today and he appeared to be asking all the right questions

I will send it to her since she interviewed

I wasn't sure you'd know who sent it but good guess
Trey was quite pleased with himself

I look forward to discussing this with you
In the meantime if you have any questions please feel free to give me a call
I will send signed contracts and numbers to Michelle
Michelle please e-mail your fax number to me
The only ones I have are unsigned
I certainly could ask him if he's interested in trading
Leslie Hansen thinks highly of him
Any way you think Andrew might like power trading
I assume that there are no changes
I can fax to you the document as she has signed it for a final check
It seems a bit pointless but thought I would double check with you
Or should I incorporate the contact information into this letter
Do you do employment agreements for EBS if not who is the attorney I should contact
Twanda would you please check my calendar and book me yes if I am available
Please let me know if you are available for this meeting
Okay so what is our next step
Michelle can you comment from a legal perspective
Let me know if we can help
The remainder of his salary is paid on US payroll
This allows him to pay in FIT withholding

Sharon could you please review the wording to ensure I haven't missed something here from a legal perspective
I will follow-up with you by phone shortly

We look forward to hearing from you
I thought the deferral information was sent to you already
Please contact my assistant Twanda Sweet for a time to have a conference call on the other question
Apparently they have temporary employees who work on projects and then leave the company
What are your thoughts on that
Should they be included or not
Do you know how other temporary employees were treated
Am I missing this or can we not put this in
The topic is technical analysis which is what she does here at Enron

Could we get together briefly to discuss employment agreements etc

Sure Twanda would you please forward
Can we get them a standard Consulting Services Agreement
If not please give me a call so we can continue working with them
These are the categories we usually fall under.
Our legal department came back with a contrac tof their own.
Twanda Sweet Twanda please forward our standard Retained Search Agreement to Don and to Gary Buck.
Here's the TalentPoint contract I was speaking to you about
Don Attached you will find the finalized contract with Addendum.
I look forward to your response
Ladies can you provide any additional information on what we are doing
Do we need additional research in this area
Also where are we on the check for Malme
I'll look into it for you
Any thoughts about what we can do to collect that amount
I have sent them a copy of the draft policy
I think it will address their concerns
I have been the point person for Corp and Azurix
During the past year upon request I have worked on employment agreements for all of these entities
I would like to be the point person for EES EBS and Wind
I am happy with that result
It struck the right chord I thought
Twanda we need executables
If you have any questions please feel free to call
It has incorporated some but not all of your changes
I am sure everything can be worked out
Let me talk to him and get back to you
So I would have to negotiate it with ELT for it to be acceptable to us
The last time you just billed for time and the actors billed separately
I prefer that approach if we can do it that way
The fees include the actors where as before they billed separately
I wonder if that is possible
Let's talk about it
Do you have any thoughts
Michelle - Can you review the following examples as well
If I should be forwarding these to someone else please let me know
Shawn - can you please review as well
I am with you
Here is another question we need resolved as well
Kim Have you asked Brian to review it as well
I think his input would be valuable
Let me know if wording changes need to be made
T Please print these for me
FYI per our conversation
If this is not possible you will need to communicate what the issues may be
As part of our toolkit Project Status Report sheets follow
Upon completion of the project initialization steps we will meet to discuss the performance evaluation process for your project
If you have any questions or concerns please call me at ext
Mr Mackin Michelle Cash has asked me to forward the language below to you for your comments
Please review and email Michelle your comments to this paragraph
Kelly I am handling Mexico and Canada
I would like us to be proactive in those situations
Let me know your availability
If so would it be possible for you to revise for inclusion in offer letters etc
I will let you fight the payment battles
Can you please confirm
I have another one for you
I hope this is helpful
You would appreciate that that gives us a slew of control compliance and legal issues
I would need to confirm with them on it
I have no problem with the dollar amount
As we discussed the Mass
It still is long but it is more current
Sure you could ask
I believe Walker's confusion was created by Diane Neilsen
Kerry I think I sent a letter and a check for partial payment last week
You indicated that you had known about the opinion but expected something much less expensive
Of course we also sent you the bill several months after the matter concluded
Have we already sent you executables
Twanda would you please make that change and run executables
Thank you for your input
In a separate e-mail I will attempt to obtain responses to the queries raised
This note is to confirm our recent telephone conversation
However it is still likely to viewed askance by potential employees above a certain level e.g
You and I need to agree on this
Again I will talk you through this
They would like to review our expat contract terms can you provide these or do I have them
I will call you to discuss
Ihave another conference call with them tomorrow morning
Twanda please print for my review
We want to ensure that we cover ourselves
Thanks for your email
I hope this answers your questions
If you have further questions please reply to both of us so that we can be aware of questions
Make the necessary changes and send a copy to us
However we still need to know who would be the employers of Rich - ENA or Expat services
Here is another opinion to support my earlier thoughts
I thought we put this issue to bed several years ago
Consultants and Contractors are to be reviewed if at all by their respective employers
Shanna we certainly can hire and manage him out if the performance is not there
Do we not think he'll be a good performer
Don't know that this alternative would be too appealing to the candidate but I can explore it with Mark
Jane I am glad that you knew the situation as I was clueless
Jon C reviewed it then but now has comments again plus he is questioning some of our changes
As you recall the file that Louise had and has signed is just a draft
Maybe we get Mich to initial and Greg to sign
Can you get Mark's signature
Once signed I will get it to London for process and sorting out the money
Thanks for all your help on this
WHat do I need to do
Mark Frevert as signatory as he is here
Tara if you didn't know our phones/computer systems were down for a while
I think Twanda has sent this
Let me know if not
Please please could I have this before we go home ie within the next hour
Sorry Tara that I have not sent this to you yet
I have made the changes already
Can I do this myself
Can I no longer do this
We'll probably want to beef it up a bit
Attached is a copy of our California Separation Agreement and Release
Dee/Rick I just learned that there are multi-employer plans for the unionized employees
I'll provide details as I learn them
I guess you can forward your comments to me with a copy to Stuart Zisman
Perhaps we did not have a correct e-mail address
Please let us know if you have any questions
Thanks for your comments on the agreement
I appreciate your other thoughts
Mary could you or someone in your group help me in putting together an example as suggested by Pat
I agree with Brian
So we probably should start with that group to see if there are any gaps in the email system
I am happy to assist in any way you would like
In my mind that activity must be addressed and ceased
Please review message and give me your comments
Given it is anonymous it's difficult to respond
Kay per our discussion here's the e-mail
Because of such confusion the reviewers when they provide input do not effectively and precisely rate the employee
Thanks for your listening ear
Nonetheless it should give you a flavor of how it works
Would this be acceptable to you
Thus I believe his experience and insight will help us in our performance management process
Should he be involved as well
Perhaps you can restate them here for everyone
Where can I find him tomorrow morning
Let me know when you want me to provide these materials
We really need to get these people feeling like they are Enron employees ASAP they feel neglected now
Patrick do you have any comments to this
Have we figured out what happened here
I haven't heard anything in a while
I apologize for the oversight -- it was not intentional
I am sorry about this one
I look forward to your comments and input
Or told they have to return these two documents along with their signed offer letter by mail/fax
I think faxing would be quicker
Gina I will leave this to your discretion
I would recommend the leaders of the appropriate councils be involved
By the way did you talk with Fran Mayes who went to the management presentations last week
Dee you might want to check with her for data
Mary yes it merely is a form issue
Sharon and Kriste have consolidated those paragraphs in their form
As I am validating these contracts I am seeing inconsistent language
Can you help me here
In some cases it may be saying the same thing but is showing up in different paragraphs
And is there any way we can get all the templates to reflect it
Just give me a call and we can talk about it
Sharon Kriste and I discussed this and agreed that simple was better
If we place this on every page I'd recommend we keep it simple and clear as is below
Does anyone believe that we need a longer statement
I want to ensure the appropriate risks have been identified documented and agreed upon by the Enron executive staff
Therefore I would like to have an agreed upon statement that can be posted in our applications
Here's one to get you started
I am fine if you want to call her
If you don't mind a delay in the return call I'll do it next week
Could you help them out
If you are booked for tomorrow early next week is our next option
Thanks in advance for your quick response
Let me know if you want to attend happy to have you there
If I have any questions I'll give you a call
I appreciate being included
You also should attend if you are interested
Cathy let's talk about the outstanding issues on Monday so that we can wrap these up
Thanks and hopefully we are nearing the end
No I have not sent any information
I doubt that Hoyt has either
You send them the information before they sign
I thing you or Hoyt have already sent the info to Mo right
His lawyer is calling me
COBRA we agreed to address it on an individual basis
Do you know if these have been sent
Do you want to just proceed with this one
Dave why don't you send it to Steve for review
When do we want to set up the training
I will prepare draft correspondence and circulate it to you Robert and Louise for comment and dart-throwing
Drew thanks I got it
I'll send it to you and Robert first
If everyone is in agreement as to the approach we can send it to Louise asap
Let me know that you received the document
If that is not your plan let me know
If you have any questions please contact me
For Conchango he does
I don't know what that means
We are actively recruiting and interviewing candidates for his activities
I simply do not have an answer for your second question
How long will he be here
I am in agreement with you on this
This week we lost an agreement that had options to be granted
Luckily for us the strike price was better/lower
If it had been the other way around we may have had a much bigger issue
I remain very very nervous that we have this covered
I suggest we meet before weekend
Are they correct
I will be glad to close this one out too
Got your fax
Will let you know when he replies
I would like to have a little more information about this
Who is she sending emails to
When were they sent
Per your request please find Flavia's contact information below
I didn't think so
Please review and provide me with your comments by this afternoon if possible
If you will not be able to respond that quickly just let me know
Hope you had a good trip back
However as a far as the precedent is concerned I would like a provision we could definitely enforce
I will call you tomorrow to discuss
Got your voicemail with Carlos' attached and will be happy to schedule the interviews for him on Monday and/orTuesday
Who did you decide he should interview with
Here's our standard decline letter
Let me know what you need and I will push him for adequate answers
I will forward you the e-mail of the employee manual
You can send your answers/comments back to me and I will make sure they get to the appropriate party
Do we need to do anything to tweak it
How do you want me to proceed
I faxed the sample down earlier today
Michelle here is the letter that Kerry and I were able to put together this morning
Hopefully this is exactly what you wanted
HR is setting up interviews with Carlos next week and you will be on the interviewer list
How would you like references run on Bonnie
Barbara HR should be contacting you about interviewing him next week. A number of folks are interested in Carlos
Mark as an update I am meeting with Carlos tomorrow
Attached is a summary of further information we have reviewed.
As you may know next week our firm will be presenting to Enron a comprehensive due diligence memorandum
I think that Enron internal would be fine
Thanks for doing this for me
Please ask Kristen Walsh if they can find him in Dallas
Then let's re-send it
Do you want to do anything else with it
Could you please answer this question
Do we need to direct this question to someone at Enron
If so you are welcome to go through the interview process
Thanks for speaking with me yesterday
Let's plan on speaking again in a few months because I would enjoy devoting the summer to your group
I can probably bounce from EES to Legal then back to EES to finish out the Associate program
If possible pencil me in
Adding value to the legal function would be my first choice
Please let me know if I can provide any additional information or if you would like to meet
That's not what I'm looking for and it doesn't apply to me at my age and experience-level
If you can schedule time to meet I'd appreciate the opportunity
If you have any questions please call us
I am giving him a black overcoat so grey probably would go the best
Dean to whom did you send the package last week
It was in the package I sent on Friday last week
If you don't have it please let me know and I'll send it.
Hope that answers your questions
Please let me know if I may be of further assistance.
Dean do you have any information to respond to the highlighted portions
As per our discussion yesterday there are numerous questions regarding Compensation in the Benefits section
It is my understanding that Compensation is responding to those issues
If you have any questions or if we can be of assistance please let us know

I do plan to attend if you have a meeting
I will let you all know what the status is by late today or early a.m tomorrow

I have asked Mark Taylor for his thoughts
I've asked Diane to send you the legal advice we received
Micelle Can you please let me know what the status of the contract template for Japan is
Since its inception EBS has seen dramatic changes in the communications industry
I am curious as to how this got to you
I will give it a review and get back with you
Is this the draft that you prepared
Attached is the Employment Agreement for Matthias Lee for your approval
Need your advice on the effective date of the agreement
Did you catch the subject line
Do you know anything about the other transactions
Thank you for your assistance in this process
Other than the specific gas-related folks I am not aware of a non-solicit of AEP employees
Alan I understand that you have approved the request below
Is this because they are WRA personnel
If you have difficulty accessing this document please contact me and I can send you a hard copy
Not a problem if the employee does not date it
Michelle I have run across a few agreements where the employee has signed the agreement but not dated it
Kathy we should go ahead and remove these people
Please remove them
Looks fine with me
I have revised an existing PRC Evaluation form
I meant to include you on this email
Any ideas re Corp or our other subs
Obviously give him or me a call as you see fit
Again thanks for your help
I have been getting this question a lot
Therefore I recommend putting one in place
Because it has been communicated that everyone will get a plan we really should follow through
On the logo issue I would have to defer to you and the PR/branding folks
God I hope not
I'd like to know who he talked with
Cynthia do you know anything about this type of requirement
Please arrange as many of these as you can
I realize NEPCO is a little different
Is it wise to put this in writing
We will be sending it out today
Thanks so much for your time and assistance
Pat what do you think of this
Should you need any clarification please write or call
Please let me know who is taking the lead on this
Valeria is looking into it
David Steve Kean asked me to forward this to you
FYI -- He tried to call me today but missed me
I'll let you know if we have a chance to visit
Chuck will be contacting you on the non-solicitation language
In fact he said he REALLY wanted to sign this today
Please note that each box should be completed in its entirety
Thanks but we got it from the vault late yesterday

For your review
Mary I think that LaQuitta should have enterprise-wide access
What do I do to get approvals for that
If you need any more information please give me a call
These changes look fine to me for employees working in Japan
As well would it be an issue to insert something about jurisdiction
If you could let me know as soon as possible it would be most helpful
FYI these should be in our form files for Japan -- this is the new Form B for Japan
He wants to go for the jugular I guess
I would appreciate seeing the numbers for budget projections and actuals for the group year to date though
Do you want to pick it up
Do we have a meeting with Shankman for tomorrow
I softened the language up after sending out the e-mail but can probably go further
I would like to include the following paragraph in the termination letter to AMPS employees Please advise
OSHA has sent a request for information as it is going to conduct an investigation
Have you heard of this
How would you like to handle it
Pat would you please give this a look and provide comments

Please let me know the outcome
I spoke with Catherine this a.m.
Willaims offices at their facility
Catherine thought Bates Churchill had an agreement with us but the company can't find it

He will be interviewing several of our weather traders
Thank you for all your help
Hey what do you suggest for a bed for Cameron when you visit
We're back in SF on Friday for the weekend with you
We had a great time I love Scandinavia can't wait to go back
Sounds like a bid idea to me but she is a stubborn little one
Still coming out to see us I hope
As soon as the draft is available we can send to you
No I know about that one and agree with you that it is critical
I just wanted to know when we were meeting with Shankman
Can that be rectified or is that beyond your role
Through this repository you can now share your ideas with others and put their ideas to work for you
The only way this will be effective however is for people to use it
I am in the process of setting up security access for these folders and need your assistance
Also if you have any suggestions or feedback please let me know
At this time I do not believe that this is a legal issue
Before we agree to modify any non-compete there must be buy-in from Mary first
Only then would we consider the request from the legal perspective
As you know Andrew Makk is to be a seconded employee from the US to London
I have not
Have we gotten Bake & McKenzie's reply/comments to the draft contract
I agree that it would be great for you
Also it is right in line with my primary responsibility now dealing with Employee Relations issues
Do you think we could make this work
Do you know of any restrictions
What courtesy protocol do we employ when considering New Power employees
I'll forward those to you for your information
Please return to me as soon as possible
Pat I am keeping you busy these days
Michelle can you give this opinion or arrange to get one
Can you give legal opinion
What other additional information do I need to provide
I will contact Kriste Sullivan in her absence
In Michelle's absence would you to establish the initial instructions and subsequent privilege governing this effort
Thanks Michelle and I look forward to meeting you
I'm sure they will enjoy the opportunity to meet you
Neither did I I just got the comments yesterday
Have you reviewed the suggestions/comments raised
Also I did not know that HR in Singapore had shown the draft to Matt
Looking forward to speaking with you tomorrow
Also in Singapore we do not use Form B but have employee signed Certificate of Compliance
Can you cover for me today
I am in mediation
I left a voicemail for Sharon Butcher as well just to make sure it is handled
If so you may want to split and cover
I will take you next one in August
I got this
After that what do we do
Do you also have a SSD we can use
Please let us know if you need anything else
I agree also but I don't know all the parties or complications involved
Can you please help with this one
I agree with what the concern is below
I think we should try to migrate to one of these
Per my voicemail message please review the note below
Through TV and newspapers I hear constantly about identity fraud using stolen social security information
I am very concerned about this issue
I have the following suggestion for our company
We could use our badge number there instead of our SS
Please calendar and print for my files on this meeting
Upon receipt I shall forward to each of you a copy of the reviews for your respective associate
Shanna I spoke with Per tonight about this
This is the background to my conversation with Shanna
I did not hear back from Shanna or Sharon Butcher
Hi Ya'll I wanted to let you know about this before I respond to her request
I think the first step is a call between yourself me Mark Stubley and Mike Indivero
Barbara please organize a call for Mike Michelle Mark Stubley and me
Apparently the City informed them that no permit is required
I'll send it as soon as it is finalized
I assume this has been calendared
Hi Michelle How do you want to have the discussion
I agree that a new master would be a good idea
Could you forward me the invitation or details
I thought we had you on this list
If an Enron employee has volunteered to fill a table their name will appear in the far right column
If you have any questions please feel free to call me directly
In my dealings with Accenture they have acted as if this is the agreement that governs them
I don't know which Accenture group is involved however
Either way I believe that it is time for an updated agreement with better rates
Have you been working with Global Strategic Sourcing on this
This is the same agreement I referred to in my e-mail
I'll get it set up
Indeed I will
Please let me know today
Do you want to call him or would you like me to
Good to see you this week
I will alert him that you will be sending him something
Thanks for thinking of us
Which lawyer at your firm should we contact
Pipefitters think they should be doing the work
We want to keep it that way
I enjoyed meeting you when I was in Bothell last week
I haven't seen a draft and I understand that the response deadline is today
Would you please let me know the status
So sorry we didn't make it yesterday
So I apologize for not making it yesterday
Hope all is well with you
I wanted to let you know that she is wonderful to work with
I consider her a true partner to my generalist duties
FYI -- here are kudos from one of your clients
Not that I know of
Thank you for visiting with Marla re Carolyn Barrett
Let me know if any adjustment is necessary
I would suggest that you ask Cynthia Barrow for starters
Sorry I am so clueless
I am working with Jeanie Slone on the Bridgeline rollover
FYI here is a survey done by one of our lawyers in California about the military pay issue
Hi Christina-- I'll check it out
I believe that's a good idea
If he is unable to find a job within Enron via redeployment this may be an opportunity for him
You know our position
I have reviewed the letter from Tobias Munk
I note that Mr Munk states that Enron is actively seeking a buyer for the platform
Can you help with this one
Could you clarify a payment classification question for me
Basically we did an incentive plan for Enron Investment Partners and now we want to dissolve it
Donna I think this falls in your court
Let me know if it should be handled elsewhere
Michelle My name is Andrew Greer and I am new on the Hrly power desk
Is that something you could help me out with
What tools do we use to trade
What does the future hold for our trading organizations
Let's discuss when we both can talk
Just delete it all
I received no comments to the contrary regarding these
Thus it appears that you can delete the material and go forward
We have not checked the law of PR do you want me to do that
Rick would you mind getting on the transition of HRRM functions to the staffing and service center groups
We should keep our own notes of conversations as they occur
Should we designate one person to handle union relations
That way we don't have the unions approaching our employees
How will it be gated
Also those people should know how to answer questions as to whether we hire union employees
They should refer such questions to HR and not answer them
Also follow our hiring practices consistently
It looks like we can
Pat do you have any insight as to the question below
Now we are considering spinning off the entire arrangement and creating a separate entity
Michelle I am unaware of what is currently happening on the Bridgeline front...can you please answer Sarah's questions
Any insight you have would be much appreciated
As you know this is not a simply question
Please let me know if you would be able to attend
Pat I hope you are feeling well
Take care of yourself
Tim I am sorry I missed catching up with you this afternoon
If the attached is acceptable to everyone the second document can be conformed to it
Has Brad discussed his involvement with his manager
Have you had an opportunity to review this issue
Shanna Per your request here is a brief description of my relationship with Bluewater Communications
That is the extent of my envolvment with Bluewater
Should we route this to you
The article discusses internal diversity studies which the plaintiffs are using as evidence to support their claims
I would like to talk about how to manage that
Hi Michelle - I hope you vacation was wonderful
We have provided a contract for review by your company and that agreement should govern
Of course -- I was just giving you grief
Otherwise we may not get a response
Sometimes you never know
Sorry if I overreated
Rose I included links to case law at bottom if you want them
Taking the next step I tried to contact Dave Lund and or Dave Hattery and they too were out
Thus I went a head and sent it out as we have historically
Thank you for your time assistance and input on this case
Again he stated he was unable to contact the claimant despite numerous calls to the claimants home
I called Mr
Ounce to advise him that our response had been mailed
Let me know if you want to know the details
Given the situation of the possible sale however we may choose not to take that route
Amy at your convenience please give me a call about Walter Coffer's review
Thank you for your prompt response
Thanks so much for sending me your friend's resume
Unfortunately it is not Enron's practice to hire attorneys right out of law school
So please thank your friend for his interest
Alternatively he may be a candidate for the Associate and Analyst Program if he doesn't want to practice law
What do you mean by backdating
Hope you both are doing well
Do we have any rules about backdating the US Exec agreements
Please keekp me posted
With a remorseful sounding voice Sheila proceeded to inquiry to= Jeff more details to which Jeff provided her
John how do you want to handle this
Let me know if you have any problems with this
I believe that Corporate can analyse this model
If they agree with me we will be implementing in future cases
Nowadays we continue to use the Enron purpose form although it contains clauses against our Brazilian labor law
If you have any doubts call me
I simply don't organize my documents that way
So I can't easily pull out corporate agreements
I hope that gives you information even if it doesn't provide exactly what you are looking for
As always your help is very much appreciated
Gina/David I think we need to have some guidelines for these types of questions
Presumably if they have a Click at Home PC they can do it from there
If not we should be able to facilitate it manually
Should we just leave theirs blank
If it is blank will it be viewed as a negative
Any gudance you can provide on these matters would be appreciated
Are you working on this
Can you reassure me you are making up for my ineptitude
Would you mind keeping Diane Goode in the loop on this
They now are calling her for help so her knowing what you are doing is essential
I am in full support
Thank you for your review and comments
That's what I thought
That was my response also
If the letter is to your satisfaction please prepare for finalization on your letterhead and send to Mr Loeb
If the memo is acceptable please initial and give it to Mr Ashman
Please provide me with a hard copy of both documents
McMichael -- we should revise in the next day or so
Bridgeline -- will be out to you tomorrow
With PRC I'm afraid I will forget these
Twanda we should email the revisions to the Rome assignment letter to that lawyer
Would you please do a draft
Attached please find termination letter that you requested
Please call me with any comments or questions you may have
If you are not the intended recipient please contact the sender and delete all copies
Hope you are enjoying the employer
Here it is flooding again -- my son's school is closed today because of flooding
Any information you can get without being obvious would be helpful
Pursuant to our telephone conversation I am forwarding you this e-mail
It's greek to me
Michelle What are your thoughts
Would there be any way to obtain details about this or is it probably a confidential settlement
I agree with your take
Is it part of the deal
If so then we will need to figure out how to document it
At a minimum I suggest Noel Michelle Cash and I meet with you
Cindy Thank you for your response
As such we may or may not need additional people for these tasks
As some of you know and many may not we are still working on Project Fireball
Many of these may not apply now that we will not purchase the entire company
Thanks to everyone for your continued support on this deal
Please contact me for specific details
We absolutely need to hold him to his evergreen
It is his responsibility to understand the contract he signed
If we have to we should sue him to prevent him from working
Additionally he believes that under the agreement the parties did not agree to joint and several liability
Rick also told me that Kevin also agrees with this interpretation
Please call me so that we may discuss
I thought that I initialed those already
If I didn't I'll do it when I get back after my vacation next week
I'll be out next week but if you have questions please call Diane Goode who works in my group
She can either assist you or find someone else who can
Or you could have Kriste respond
I do not remember seeing a letter from counsel but it is possible that it fell through the cracks
Let me know if you have any interest
We drove by your house which looked like it took on some water
I hope all is ok and that you didn't have too much damage
Twanda can connect you
A call to him might get this off dead center
Of course we had it and didn't need it
We also pulled up our rugs moved furniture etc
Had we not the house surely would have flooded
Talk to you next week
Yes I should be involved
Have you sent Noel prior information
I have seen some emails about this recently
I will see what I can find out
Has your firm done any legwork on sabbaticals
Any information policies research pitfalls or other experience you or others at the firm may have would be appreciated
Look forward to working with you on it next week
Has he already called on the acquiring company
If so then I would think it would be ok
Twanda would you please print
Here is the standard form I use for an employee manual
I also will check around for other manuals you could review
I didn't get a specific reason from prior emails
If he needs to locate people shouldn't Peoplefinder do it for him
Since Mike is a temporary employee he doesn't meet the criteria
Kathy -- you sent this back but did you mean to make a comment
Therefore would you please set him up with a # to access ExpertFinder
Please let me know when this happens
Would you please send Janice Priddy the blank short form
Are they paid in the same year the employee terminates
Do you have a copy of this agreement
John I have been approached by HR with the following request which I would like your input
Twanda will you please handle this
Could you forward an Exhibit A template to me
Also we usually use some other language
I'll ask Twanda to send you our standard retention letter
It shouldn't take long as it is only one page
Twanda thanks for sending me this language
Do you know this person
I am writing to ask for your help
She/he seeks position that will enhance and build upon their experience
Irma Thank you for taking to time to meet with Cheryl and I
I prepared the attached as minutes to our meeting if you will
Please let me know if you have any corrections or additions
I think that your expertise is needed on this agreement
I will send you a copy of the latest term letter along with my handwritten comments on the draft
Would it be possible to get your comments/thoughts on these
Yevgeny will contact you directly
Pursuant to my prior email here is the draft term letter
I will forward my handwritten comments
Attached below is a document that summarizes our intent
Please review it and lets get together to discuss the language
Attached please find above notes from our Meeting with Meliza Evanson for your file
All agreements may now be forwarded to Mary Joyce as well as Dana Bryant our new compensation analyst
Will do once I receive the revised agreement from them
I spoke with her and got this information
After sitting down with both I made my recommendations and I got their feedback as well
I have attached our current termination process flow
I hereby authorize Enron to withhold from my check or checks any and all amounts outstanding
Again if you could please give me your approval or feedback asap that would be great
Thank you ma'am
Irma Attached is a copy of the Card Agreement we use for the AMEX apps
Alan do you want to talk with this guy while he's in town
Michelle Steve's name isn't on my list of those resumes we discussed last week
Are you and/or Alan interested in talking with him
Executive Compensation said they did not receive a copy
Can either one of you help us locate a copy
Diana can you look in our files to see if we have an agreement on Barbara
I think this is in your ballpark not mine
Would you be available
In fact it is a selling point to attract night shift talent
Please let me know if I may proceed with signatures
Who will get them
Otherwise if it goes to him at his request then there is no protection if we find undesirable results
I'd apprecuate your thoughts
Generally their seminars are high quality
Let me know if you plan to attend
I don't think that is a good idea
I like that better
Or do we want to do that separately outside of the PRC evaluation meeting
How about you come in and brief them orally
Thank you ma'am for your quick response
I like this approach
Let's document it and let people know
I do not see a problem
Michelle do you agree
However we thank you for bring it to our attention
I can't attend as I'll be out of the office in Austin at a mediation
Jo Ann I think it is a great idea to invite Todd Brad and Melissa
I know that Michelle would agree
Michelle -- I would like to attend this seminar
Would it be OK to send to them
Jo Ann would you be available to attend
How are we answering this type of question
If they want to is there any legal reason not to do it
He told me this a.m that you and I were sending him the same stuff
I guess that I would look at this a bit differently
However Alice does not recommend that we attempt to recover our costs
No but we have been meeting on this topic
I will ask Diane Goode to include you by phone if you want to attend
We're meeting now near my office -- can you come
They are done and should be in your email today
I get daily calls and they understandably are getting annoyed
I know you are happy to have that wrapped up
Thanks to all it's been great working with you all
I think this works
Attached for your review are the scripts the script talking points and the agendas for training catagories Regards Rj
Michelle I don't know if I have the final restated plan document
I'm not sure what changes anyone made after my last draft
We have a babysitter that night already although I am sure we could cancel it
Please schedule me to attend this meeting
I spoke with Fran about the Leaf River contracts
Once we get those we can generate a draft for review and comment
I understand that Fran has asked Eric for this data
Would you please handle this
I'll get back with you asap
Do we need to have our meeting today
I could sure use the time for some other meetings
Michelle I would like to recommend that when the H.R
Do you see any problems with this
The good news is we don't owe a mediation fee right
Michelle & Rick do we want to answer this question now
Where can they be found
So we should be careful about the audience for these communications
I suggest getting with Rick Johnson on that issue
If we do that any language in the memo related to severance will be very generic
Sorry I can't do it myself but I just don't know anything about the pipes
Of course I need this as soon as possible
I will send you a new waiver form to use
The one you are using is not valid under the ADEA
I agree that it is best to leave alone
Last I checked the severance plan is not currently listed on the intranet
Send to me
Let me know how I can help
I don't think we should curtail cause terminations
So we can't say that there is not plan in place righ now
Please give me your feedback as soon as possible
Let him pursue his claims with everyone else
Sandra we need the password
I think that we should enforce the agreement
Did he get a signing bonus
If so he probably will have to pay back
Effective immediately diversification within the Plan will now be allowed regardless of your age from ALL company contribution accounts
This looks fine with me
I think that is right but I do not have the data to confirm that
If we agreed to do so then our records should reflect that service date
Here are the referrals that I received
I have been networking with William M Mercer Company a subsidiary of Marsh McLennan Companies
They are clearly the top in their field
I have a strong relationship with Hewitt
Hopefully this will be useful to you
Christy we'd certainly appreciate it if you suggested Hewitt
Also we have a number of consultants who work on the issues mentioned
It was good seeing you at the reception
We also had reference to Jeanneret & associates but I know you know them
If you need an economist try these folks
Based on our conversations to date I would think the PriceWaterhouse and Mercer contacts would be your best bets
Ill see what I can find out for you
Both of us are still here
You of all people know how hard yesterday was for me
The answer depends so we need to be careful about how we answe it
Thanks for checking with me
Attached is the report you requested
I am working with Mary Joyce on that right now
I think we should consider this request
For your reference I am forwarding the following from Cindy Adams
I think he should also know the truth
Thank you Tim for your feedback as I continue to appreciate and value your advice
It might be helpful in attempting to have your reviews amended
I found her call strange as so much time has passed
Her disruptive behavior only reflected her thoughts
I just thought I'd share this with you
Some people never cease to amaze me
Per my conversation with Britt on Friday attached is a draft notice of bankruptcy in the Event case
I was not served with the motion but Rodney told me about it and I have received his response
I would like to join with a short response on Enron's behalf a draft of which is attached
I'll forward those to Kathy so she can get started
I got this request a second time
Do either of you know the answer to this
Do you know who would know the answer to this question
Please let us know
If you have any questions please email or call me
Can we do that
We have decided not to make any reps about these plans since any buyer would not be taking them
Which deal are you actively working on
Do I need to be working on the draft agreement
Here are my comments
Activities should center only on your business requirements
Go ahead and let them stay until vesting
He gave you too much information
Would you please provide this data to me and Kalen
I think it is regular course but we may have to change that regular course
So when people are termed they will receive prorated vacation not full as in past plus any carry over
Why can't we get this one out
Here it is for posting
I agree -- involve Valeria
You also should invite my new lawyer Lizzette Palmer
Twanda is her assistant also
I will have Jo Ann schedule a meeting next week
Michelle I think it would be a good idea to include Valeria Hope
She was instrumental in helping me last year
PR seems to think that Glen signed off on doing it
Happy to give them but no reps are going to be made as I understand
We are going to give it to them
That is what I was told
I believe Michelle approved
Mich can you confirm
David - Ok with you
I hope you are doing ok
Of course the claim will be stayed due to bankruptcy but it is interesting that she finally did it
I will subject to having the opportunity to review it
Michelle can you please approve this request
Kathy I know how many unreasonable requests you've had to put up with over the past few months
I hope that this isn't another one
Forgive me and set me straight if this can't be done
Maureen as soon as I receive anything I'll forward it on
I am working on it and have been since yesterday
I have some top level contacts with Delotte's Human Capital group
Meanwhile I think the best non-attorney group on downsizing is probably Right and Associates
Call me if you would like specifics
Let me know what we can do to help
Should I just give names or SSN
It is my understanding that this info is needed by Monday
Are we agreeing to this
Would you know where these need to be sent
Hi Cathy how are you
I wonder if you can help me with this
Thanks for your prompt attention to this matter Regards Rj
If the people have employment agreements we will need to assign
Would suggest we leave them where they are
How does he want to change it
If it is more generous then I think we should discuss
Is this a question that you can address
Has there been a business decision to novate his agreement
I am not aware of our decisions to novate any agreements
I think we should have Charles Foster in on this call
I will call to see his availability today and advise
Tim who at Tindell and Foster is working their cases and Michelle and you and I call them today
I have lost all of my e-mails and along with them your fax number
Could you please tell me it again
If there is a change however I would make it to the SSD instead of the main agreement
That way we won't have to live with it for every placement
What would you recommend
Can we do something asap
Hey Michelle Did you guys address the non-compete issue for terminated employees
Has anyone at your end prepared anything in writing
Let me know when it can be distributed
Kalen do we still have the disclaimer on these
I'd like to make sure that it appears on every set
I can call Vicky to get her to verify but that will delay the submission of the wire
Tim/Mike - Can you get us the wiring instructions please
I am happy for you to handle the Richter matter
I'll confirm with David Lund that he has no objection
I'm working on it
I requested an exception due to your circumstances
I feel that my hands are tied at this point
If any one has any other ways to get this through let me know
I just spoke with Marcus Pullicino
He did not find a wire transfer in the system for me much less a wire transfer confirmation number
Can you please let me know what's going on
Marcus - Can you please assist Vicki with this request
Could you please forward to me the wire transfer confirmation number
I don't show that the money has entered my account
The name on her account is Vicky L Martinez
I have Robin calling the bank to verify
Ill check around I have a good friend who works there
Let me know if the plan is different
Have we assigned employees to netco
I didn't think we had
Could you resend
I don't think we have seen that
By the way Fran Mayes and I both will be at the office tomorrow
Disregard my prior e-mail
As to solicitation of employees back and forth it will be a negotiated deal term
We think it may be payable as a past expense
Can you supplement the answer to the visa question
What assistance is the company providing me
Q Will I be able to receive severance in the future if I file for unemployment
If you receive additional severance in the future it will be offset by any unemployment wages you have received
Q Will I be paid for any unused vacation
I will forward emails to you as I receive them
Sally Per our conversation yesterday below is a list of EGM employees that we would like to reinstate
As I have more comments I'll send them on
As I re-read I found more references to vesting or payout dates
Mike I have attached a letter which was sent to Ming's home last evening
I appreciate your willingness to respond to Ming but would prefer that all future communication come from Michelle Cash
Also Michelle Cash will be drafting a communication to all who were copied on Ming's message to you
Thanks Shanna Shanna How should I respond to this
I should give her a response even a bland recognition via return email
As a consequence my reasonable request for a re-deployment package has been rejected
Mr Bezanis and Mr Jeff Andrews were present in the conference room as I entered
I was suspended and sent home with pay with possible termination
Until now Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results
I was banned by him from developing the idea further
Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence
I request your attention and help during my most difficult time
I discovered this when working on the package for Pickering
David has agreed to take the agreement to Louise and Mark once he is comfortable
He wants to keep it simple
Please review and let Pat and I know your thoughts
Kindal have authorised. let me know if you have any questions
Karen I like the questions and understand the need for them
You sent this to me Dan
George's view is that we will control how we handle the employees not GP
Recognizing your need for flexiblity we need to find a solution to that issue
Thats the approach I would take with these people
Hello All Els gave birth to our healthy daughter Laura last Tuesday
I'll have my assistant get with you on calendaring
I hope we can count on your participation
I guess he has sour grapes
We only paid him not to apply for a job -- unfortunately insults were not contemplated in our agreement
Didn't we pay this guy to go away
How can we make him stay there
You actually did me a favor and I am doing great however I still think you are a prick
Hopefully we are very close to completion
Let me know if you require more information
Here is what we are hearing
We'll keep you posted
I have signed both agreements
You will receive them shortly
I am assuming it is it
The revised information will be couriered to you this afternoon
Below is the information you requested...thanks for the help
I would appreciate your review of the policy set out below
As you can see the policy has already been circulated without legal review
While we may all have had comments or suggestions is there anything you think would require recirculation
Below is the policy note that we talked about earlier today
FYI in case you don't already have this
If however they rescind their application before termination it is not a voluntary term
If the situation arises however I think we should reevaluate at that time
Michelle do you think we need to have NY counsel review the separation agreement
I expect by Tues Weds next week we will have determined which employees applications will be accepted
With this in mind can I ask you to take a look at the following acceptance and rejection letters
Do they then by default receive involuntary severance
I hope that we can make it
Did you have a chance to respond
We are getting through it
Cameron actually wore his yellow rain slicker his yellow rain shoes and his red fireman's hat
So instead of rain boy he was a fireman
I must admit that he looked absolutely adorable
Your bash sounds like it was a lot of fun
I wish I could get Trey to dress up but he really isn't into that type of thing
Still I enjoyed it quite a bit -- escaped into the music
Still we had a great time
Well I'd better get back to it
Well he said it's tight and kinda itchs
You're good then that's how it feels - I told him
Say hi to Trey and Cameron for me
Please update your address files for all McKesson employees
I have seen this but I don't think it should go out
David/Mary/Cindy please correct me if I'm wrong
Michelle Have you had a chance to look at this
Please make sure legal reviews before it is used and/or distributed
I got this without an attachment
Do you have
Neil why not put them under an agreement
Thanks Neil Dear Neil Sorry I was traveling on Friday when you called
I do not really care which one we use I thought this might help you out
I look forward to our meeting
Michelle Twanda would you please do a standard confidentiality agreement for this company for my review
If this is correct enjoy your computer
Let's get with Tommy to expedite it if you want
Any officer can sign for Enron -- generally speaking we like to have the BU head sign
Who should sign it for Enron
You mean for her process in particular right
I will get John to sign it then
Sure we could set up an LLC entity to employ those people
We need to talk about that meeting with me Mike and John
I do not think it went well at all but I would like to discuss it with you
Let me know if you have any comments or suggestions
I will fax it over to you today
Definitely count us in
We'd love to join you
Or is she still with Comsys
Let us know if you guys can join us
Go ahead and ask her to have the attorney call me
If I receive any information from this atty I will send your way
Some of them may have left the company and others may never have been employed
Will you have access to all current/former employees' information
It might help if I gave you the names
Can you provide the answers for me
Then I can decide how to proceed with Arthur
Let me know if you would like any more information
Let me know if there is any big news at Enron
Not needed -- we have Ogletree on it
First let me say that I am sorry about the delay in responding to your earlier email
I do not have any of this information -- Cathy is the Metals plan the same as Enron domestic
Feel free to work with me on it but I just don't have any data
Any assistance you could provide would be much appreciated
From what I can tell she needs info for Reps and Warr
I am not aware of any
I am happy for us to paper the deal
Once ready I'll ask Michelle's support for the execution approval and I will let the commercial team know
When I speak of processing it relates to the processing of the checks/wire transfers
Michelle Is this on your form
He will report to me
I do not believe that we have been properly served however so we appear to have additional time
Let me know how you want me to proceed
I just don't want all the other communications enclosed
I have not released any information to anyone
Please let me know if you need anything further
For your information David there is nothing magic about the training they are doing
Ogletree does not have a monopoly on it
Also since it is out in the boonies it would take a while to get back inside the loop
Would it be possible for us to arrive late
I'd hate to create a disturbance but I think Cameron would like to attend both things
Mary Joyce/Michelle I hope all is well with you
I look forward to hearing from you Regards Diomedes
Pam I guess a separate line of inquiry is whether we owe him payments under his employment contract
He gave me some scoop on the trip
If you would prefer to forward them to someone else for formal review please do so
Add to your question list
You came and spoke to my new hire class last Monday
I am certain there will be no problem
We are planning to attend although I am going to a networking happy hour at my old firm
I have got to get out there as you can appreciate
But I hope to see you at Kari's house
I know Trey and Cam will be there
If he wants it
But I would like a waiver so I think we should consider some sort of payment
T Would you please send runner to get this
I would drop them off but it is a long story
These are all the items for you
That is fine but I do have to get Cameron today so let Shanna know
How are we handling others in that group
If they meet with your approval we will send the requests out today
Will you be attending
I assume that no waiver of liability is needed since an offer letter does not incur liability
Miller she insists is on the receiving end only
He takes orders dispatching and scheduling solely in response to orders he receives from others
I look forward to discussing with you our response
Can you provide an appropriate waiver document
Does this cover your bases
Thank you for your question
I've asked her how much
What else do you need from me to paper this
Seems unusual to me
Would you please give me a call at your earliest convenience
Still doesn't make you wish you were from Newark does it
If you have other forms that you think work better please send them our way
The attachments didn't make it
Here are two memos for review by you
Please review and let us know if you have any questions
I have been working those
If you have additional revisions/suggestions that you would like to submit please let me know

I will run by external tax counsel with utmost discretion
Are we contemplating including any insiders

He is at EB where she is doing a Super Saturday
Never mind on this -- Twanda took care of it
As we discussed here is the second set of Q&As
Please forward any revisions to me
I know Robin quite well
Please let me know what we can do to help
I needed a little levity
Should you have any questions or concerns about the process please do not hesitate to contact me directly
In case you didn't get this
Who do I need to make the cheque out to
In the meantime I am comfortable with this level of risk
Ya'll let me know if you disagree
The letter does not address what to do if we revoke or if the applicant revokes
As such I think we have some exposure here
I can't assess how much in part because I don't have an estimate of the dollars at issue
If not we can't proceed
Please run Scott Earnest's executables from his last draft
I do not have signed copies of several Enron Canada agreements
I appreciate your assistance
Twanda how can we get these
Can we enlist Knudsen's help
Would you mind asking the vault if they have these
If not could you get with Knudsen to get them
As mentioned in my voice mail Pat McCarthy is the attorney we use for GSP employment matters
I hope that is helpful
Absolutely I agree with that
David and I have reviewed and agree that we should send
We would like your thoughts and/or suggestions
Until the final decisions have been made I ask for your continued patience
Attached is a copy of the summary for your review
Please let me know when we can quickly get together
Do you want the same info from EEL
Sheila I understand Tammy is on vacation
So we need a list of the employees whose Agreements to be assigned
Please let me know who can get started on this project
In that situation we definitely want to know about it so that the docs can be assigned
With her explanation of how their agreements are structured is this a relevant exercise for them to go through
Please add any we do not have on this list
Please call me or Kari Oquinn if you have any questions
Pat please let me know if my email of last night did not go through
I have already drafted two amendments a restated plan document and a form of resolution terminating the plan
Kriste and I substantially revised the waiver agreement today so sit tight=
Kriste do you want to add the mediation provision
On th= e waiver I've scratched out some paragraphs and told you I would send othe= r language
I need to have the names as soon as possible even if they may choose not to do it
Mark H had asked me not speak to them until after I'd met with Richard Sanders
Mike Muskat called me back this morning
I've passed along my comments and changes
He will send a revised version today for your review next
I have spoken with Kevin on this
If prior to that you would like to engage Rome in settlement discussions directly feel free to do so
Have we paid him the remainder of his contract
Valeria I agree that we need her to execute that note by a date certain
Could you please provide the recommended next steps
For simplicity I would use the ethnic codes we have in datamart/sap rather than creating new ones
That makes it easier to populate
I took a shot at combining the two spreadsheets
Pat I really like that approach
Kriste did you get this
If not I think it really works
The only one in question is for Brian Redmond whose contract we did not have
Stewart called me last week for some advice
So I gave him your names as backup in case he needs immediate assistance
With that thought I have asked Tim O'Rourke's team to work on such a protocol
She understood that Shapiro had said it was ok Do you know about that
If not should you give Andrea a call about it
I am concerned about the floodgate effect so I believe we should proceed with extreme caution
Let me know your thoughts on this
This proposal makes me most nervous
I am a bit unclear
Are these ready for my final review yet
If so I will get right on them
Thanks I agree
Karen is this now ready for my review
This also has proved itself out as we go forward
This is fine but is it harsh enough
Michelle Below is a draft discipline letter for your approval
Repeated violations will subject you to further discipline up to and including termination
I told him we were ready and willing to proceed
So I'll keep you posted
First thought can we re-schedule
I am not sure I understand the question
Give me a call when you have a chance
Can you run this one by Michelle
We cannot provide them with legal advice
Here is my suggested response Enron's policy is to not comment on current litigation
Lizzette can you help us draft an answer to these questions
I don't think that is true
I agree with Michelle
If possible put it on all documents as well as the cover of the notebook
Please let me know ASAP so I can finalize the documents
We should reiterate that we can't provide with legal advice
What is he asking
Do you think we should answer this question
Michelle are you comfortable answering this question
Simone how do I get to LiveLink again
Can you provide Ann with this information asap

FYI and akin to our meeting this morning
Please forward this newsletter to your friends and co-workers
We offer our condolences to those of you who = have lost loved ones friends or colleagues
First understand that we are all affected
Let me simply make a list
Either get them together in person a group e-mail voice= mail teleconference - whatever means are available to you
When= closing it down don't go dark without notice
Maybe it affects your communications transportation= distribution or some other aspect of your operations
It= is important to keep talking to each other and their children even those= very young children
We will address those questions as they arise but for= now they are beyond the scope of this communication
We talked ab= out our personal feelings
In other words we took care of ourselves and we took care of others
I urge you to do the same
That way we at least can explain why we did things
But this is what we did last year
It looks like they are being ranked to measure performance not for compensation
If so then it would be nice for there to be some rough correlation to compensation
If it is P&L and some other components then let's specify what they are
Assistants and clerks looks good although it looks like OOC will decide bonus amounts
Otherwise if they are not pretty standardized the same issues arise as above
Suggest we send to HR for them to implement
Here is our plan on PRC
How will my immigration status be affected when my employment ceases
I hope this is what you are looking for
Let me know if we need anything else

Thanks for all your help on the move/relocation
Certainly I am pursuing these reliability concerns with Steve Hotte
When systems or the Internet are down we can't get to the contact info

If you think we need more things for the treat bags this is a possibility
I have wanted to congratulate you on your promotion
I am so happy for you
I would like to catch up with you on business matters and more importantly on international adoptions

I hear you are feeling somewhat better
Can't wait to see you again
Rob said to forward this to you
Maybe we can find a time to watch it
I will not be at choir rehearsal on Sunday
I will be at both services
Rehearsal went well on Sunday but we were missing quite a few kids
They know it
I can't remember if that's actually the name of it
It is such a nice song I think the choirs should sing it together
We can take a look and see what we think
I know the confirmation class's mystery trip is that weekend
I don't know whether that will interfere or not
Shelley have you scheduled the meeting with Rod to discuss some measurement issues
Maybe you could start a after Chrismas gift sale

If we assume under our control costs would be the same or slightly lower
I would propose the same for now

Sorry our time on the phone was short this morning
Since you get home late Sat I am anticipating that you'll want to sleep on Sunday
Last night the Kudla's came over and we ate take-out

I love you and I'm always thinking of my three Valentines
Can you please take care of this

Lynn and Steve will attend for me
If you need more information please let me know
Sorry we were unable to have a staff meeting this morning
Please let Ricki know about your availability
I will be out of the office next Tuesday morning
Chad thought we were on a treasure hunt
They both have the sniffles and I have a sore throat
Man I don't want to get sick again
I can do any of these dates
I'd rather it be just us for this meeting
Sorry I missed you this morning
Could you take a look at this description from the outline
I'm back in my office
Although it is only Tuesday I am already trying to plan for the weekend
How is it going in Kim's absence
If I can assist in any way please let me know
If not can you tell me who will so that I can update the TPA on the website
Any numbers for me
Can you send me the latest version
Great Rosemary I'm so slow in thanking you for the lovely party
My sister will be here for our lunch on Monday too
Christi I am happy to make the reservations if you want
In light of the immediate change in their assignments I asked John and Terry to switch desks
I need you authorization to move their telephones
Thank you for the support
I'll forward the latest copy that Jayshree sent me yesterday afternoon
I still need to check that all our comments were added
Can you tell me if you bought pre-cooked chicken and if so where you got it
Also was that just romaine lettuce you used or pre-mixed greens
Did you toss a dressing in the salad and if so what kind
I need your authorization to move their telephones
Gaby told me that she cannot attend
Let me know if you think I should change this arrangement
I can't think of anyone we missed for the party except Bobby Oldfield
I inadvertently dropped her name from the list
Thank you for everything you do
I'm always overwhelmed by your kindness
Hi Shelley I am looking forward to seeing you and Alina tomorrow for the shower
Just so you know Laura and Kathryn will be here tomorrow and can help entertain Alina if needed
We will have plenty of food so if anyone asks you please tell them just to come
Would you deliver the pre-made meals to the home
But we won't have non Enron pipeline throughput until they publish
If we want to estimate it that would be fine also
Please let me know if you have this information
I j found three more minor nits
Sorry but I don't have an isolated power plant capex number
I changed that in one prior draft
I will start gathering that data
Are they the designee
We have several small customers we're still chasing but Orlando is the most significant outstanding issue we have left
Also I'm not sure we have our act together
I am especially concerned about the suggested tolerances
Given our recent discussions they may be too low
If anything it seems like they are less then the recent Shelley/Mike guidelines
Finally Shelley and Mike may be concerned if we sent it out without their comments
I will continue to press for input
Why can't we just get Sheila's signoff
It isn't like we are doing anything radical here
I think Trunkline should actually review before Shelley anyway
I have not heard back and she is not in today
So I just sent the draft to Mike to get his input
I just got this message
Do we care
Are we worried about having competitive Zone E/F rates
In our meetings today on Order No
When you have a chance - can we talk about this
I hope your week has gone well
How did you make sure it was the right set
Will it be delivered
This will make my week
Last week I was invited to a forum but I was disappointed that I could not attend
If anything comes out of this meeting that sounds particularly interesting I will let you know
Also if there is a topic you would like me to comment on please let me know your thoughts
I'll try to attend this meeting if you need me
But I would like to dispel the suggestion that Jerry put together the spreadsheet for me
Shelley--If you have time on your schedule would you also attend this meeting
Please bring your copy to the meeting
Wednesday will work best for me
I hope you enjoyed the rest of your weekend
Brianna and I loved the sing-a-long Sound of Music
I can't explai= n why no one heard the bell
Thanks for your concern
While it was very scary for Helen I'm satisfied with Randy's reply
I don't know who/what got everything stirred up today
I'll let you know when I figure it out
I'm not sure Alma but I thought it is Ricki
Do you have any idea who pays for Shelley's pager
Don - I never heard anything back
Shelley first of all I apologize for not responding in a timely manner
I should have responded that we were waiting to gather additional comments if any and make one global response
By copy of this memo you can anticipate that Mike will forward a response shortly
Was I the first D-In-Law to wish you Happy Birthday
Was I the first
Can't what to see you this weekend
Think about where you want to go to dinner
If problem arise we will reconsider the decisions
I have been building spreadsheet cases all day
FYI - majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers its driven by the volume
I made the appropriate changes on Galen's spreadsheet
Do you see a problem with this
I didn't understand we were borrowing them
I thought we already reached agreement to buy them
Are you still here
Haven't seen or heard from you in a couple of days
Did you meet with Deb
I haven't visited with Stan lately
Why do you ask
I'll try to sit Down with him next week
What is an Ambassador Doll and where can I buy one
We are trademarking it
Unfortunately with her being a non-employee she will need to get a temp badge everyday
Let me know if you hear something
Are you watching Kinder Morgan stock this morning
I was planning pasta for dinner
I will be ordering pizza tonight so please don't make other arrangements
Thought you would be interested in this

I think things are off to a good start with VBS
Please let me know whether you are available at this time
I apologize for the late notice
I approve of the below-noted access
If we can't pitch the old documents I will probably have to send them to the records center
Shelly I have not responded to Jane's email
I will respond today or tomorrow
You are going to be so very mad at me but I have lost my ATM card
Can you cancel my card
I saw you called what do you need
I'm in a class and can call at break if you need to talk otherwise email me
I can address it then
When did you lose it
Thank God it is not a Debit Card
If any of these cancel I have a back-up list
Please give me the invites for those two
I'll take care of their transport
Can you do lunch this week
I hope you had a nice weekend
I'll have to do this by phone with you
I really need to talk to you though
Could you give payroll a call
That's just off the top of my head
Again once the system is operating again I will check into this
I need for Mike to carry a Blackberry
This is the committee I was on for a year
Mike all I have in electronic format is the UAF portion of the report
I'm thinking that we may miss church altogether on Sunday
We may spend the night at my inlaws in Conroe
When I get a little better info
I will make Children's Church plans
If not maybe I can enlist my husband
If so I can get the CD from you then
I'll let you know if I'm successful
Mr Chad is still sick today but he much appreciated the bear
I'll have my cell phone with me too
I sure enjoyed dinner last night -- ice tea and all
For what it is worth I believe you made the right choice recognizing it was not an easy one
Your judgment is sound and you should believe in it
I hope you are feeling more confident in your choice now
Thanks for your words of wisdom to me
Just how did we get to be so Type A
Thanks I found this too
I am looking to schedule a Vacation Bible School Training Meeting
I was gone all of two minutes
I needed a bathroom break
I'll catch up wti you tomorrow
Is that really where we are sending our registration information
But frankly this whole process was a surprise to me
I was surprised when a resident alien card arrived
Dear Families Rod Archer gave me a better place for you to download the Registration form for the Embassy
Will these dates work for you
Ramona Linda Trevino and their team will also be in the office Sunday morning for support
I am still working on both but wanted to get something to you
I don't plan for us to sign on we'll just wait for it to hit the board for vote
FYI I saw Ken Caminiti at Animal Kingdom yesterday
I can either plant this Sat or next
If you guys already mulched last week then I can manage the planting on my own
If not I could use help with mulching the beds before I plant
I'll be thinking of you
Call me when you get to the office
That is the way we usually come
Shelley Read Patty's comments and I will call you in the next day or two to discuss
Yes I volunteered to continue to keep up the flower beds again this year
I was planning to pick up some flowers early Sat
Congrats to you on your recent wedding
I am so thrilled for you both
Please let me know if you need help in any way
I really enjoyed our talk last night
You gave me some really good advice
I think Alina would love the water rafting
I only wish that I could have done more
Recently and facilitated by the ease of using e-mail we had planned to start a semi-annual Alumni Newsletter
And it is nearing the bank/shore
Coast Guard will meet us at site
I am assuming Elizabeth will be in to help me
Given these operational concerns we do not understand the rush to adopt flowing day recall standards
The pipeline claimed that it only listened during the meeting
Great thanks - that gets to the heart of it
I suppose that with respect to planning separateness would apply
Thanks I needed a little bedtime reading
I will incorporate your changes in the next turnaround along with the Batchelder comments due tomorrow
What is the latest on your travel time frame
Hope everything is moving quickly ahead for you
Or are you still swamped from being out of the office
I signed up for the class today
Your family is also welcome to stay in our guest apartment
I'll give you better directions later
I'll join you late if I can
If you are available please feel free to join us
I talked with Maria re who signs TPAs for NNG

With only one significant exception the groups acknowledge their tasks/responsibilities in the measurement process
We may need his support
Therefore I'm supporting him on the base contract
Can we schedule lunch next week
I am available on Monday Wednesday or Friday
Tuesday is possible I would need to move another appointment
Thanks of your words of encouragement
Let me point out this is NOT sucking up
However congratulations on your new endeavor
Don't get me wrong I'm not unhappy where I am just seeking opportunities to expand
Please add to my calendar Great
I could be wrong however
Stan told me that you were using that title too
Glad you decided to stay...have a good weekend
Bob Did you get in touch with TK
How did you negotiate the chief comm title
You did more in a day than I did in several years
Yes I have a new job
On the other hand we could just relax pool side
We'd love to spend the day with you and gimpy
Just let me know your leisure preferences
I hope you had a nice visit with your guests
I hope to see you all sometime soon
What are your plans for Easter
Will it affect my Blackberry
Please review this announcement and let me know of any changes
After I hear from you I'll forward this to Stan for his approval
Please advise if you approve this request
But the issue we still need to work through is the fact that Alina is still scared o Kim
Ginger I was able to get Ginger on her cell phone
Well at least we for sure will be able to do the conference
Should I free up this time on your calendar
If I can help in anyway please call
I just had my head in the clouds
I am avialable tomorrow afternoon
Will you call me or should I call you
She said she is really busy because Chris is on vacation
It wasn't one of our better days
If it's okay with you I'd like to take a week break next weekend
Also Stan is not available the third weekend in November so I have agreed to switch with him
Hi Shelley I hope all went well on Sunday
Will you be there next Sunday to handle music
I am feeling pretty blue today with all the Enron stuff
Please also calculate the value of your Transocean options
I may want to monetize these to cover adoption/travel expenses
I now have another meeting over the lunch hour
Are you available for lunch today
I didn't realize that you were working on Gulfstream items too
What is your team working on on Gulfstream
So it is all in Ginger's hands now
I am getting home early
I am out of town on business tonight
I didn't hear from Ginger this week
I am out of town on business
Are you interested in dinner tomorrow night at cafe express
We can work around these plans if you prefer
Are you going to apply
Now I'm back at my desk
Here is my mark-up
Please make sure that it is factually correct
If Stan is unavailable I think Phil Lowry or Mike Nelson would also be great choices
Thanks for your insight
Can I get your opinion by Thursday
Additionally we must continually revisit the way we allocate our res= ources to reflect client priorities
That is part of the = challenge we face but also part of the fun we enjoy
Thanks I needed that today
Why wouldn't the HOA pay their bills
I thought this might interest you
However you also note there is no consequence when we aren't able to accomplish
Here is a draft for your review
To improve the effectiveness of your slide show you might consider reducing the number of bullets in some slides
This will make your audience more comfortable and enhance their retention
Thanks for the effort and energy you put into your session
I'll let you know if I hear anything else
Have some adorable pictures of your child you'd like to share
No one ever asked us for the results in Kazakhstan or Russia thankfully
I would really like some information about it
The tantrums just crack me up because of their similarities
Of course that's cuz we havent had one here in a week
So I'm leaning against it but he of course is leaning towards it
Once we got our luggage and made it through customs to our coordinator the sun was just coming up
We were able to store our luggage under the bences
If you have any questions feel free to email me
This was one of the best decisions we made early on
Academically they would have been better off but socially it would have been disasterous
I live in Connecticut
I have already been in touch with them
Many thanks and I look forward to 'meeting' all of you
If he catches up academically we may consider skipping a grade
He is by the way not the only one his age in his class
On top of this he was from a household where the parents spoke almost entirely Russian around the house
You will have to implement them at the appropriate time
All of your benefits information has been updated
Hey Sean sorry I hung up there
Hope your doing well
Let me know if you have any questions or need assistance
I'll be putting it in today
I think I fixed them
Let me know if there are any other problems
For you Stewart anything
Once you see a list of plants click on unit name for more data
I wouldn't agree the caps have hurt liquidity
In fact in the Northwe= st at least they have actually increased liquidity
I would propose the following cap timelines
Assume that stage I II or even III is a certainty
This created uncertainty exactly when it shouldn't happen=
If we sell at the cap and incurr losses then we can't sell a= t the cap
Here are some questions/comments I have regarding the ruling
Work on my discipline
Thanks Bruce I appreciate it
I forward this on to McCabe
Joe Toussaint will be talking to him
I will get you an answer this week
I think I would like to see Cinergy's bid
I sort of have to weigh many nonfinancial issues as well
It would be nice to know where we are at
If you could provide me a rough number that would be helpful
If you still interested let me know
Thanks for coming to see us
We sure would love to have you on the team
Hope you had a good vacation
I was just touching base to see where we're at
Looks good then let's try it
Here are the documents we discussed
For your convenience I have my changes tracked
Please let me know if this works
I'd also like to confirm my understanding of Duke's compensation program
This is what I recall from the interview
Regardless of what happens I appreciate your time and consideration
I should be able to come to a decision next week
One of our strongest guides is with him and he too will probably die
This guy is super strong but the altitude has snatched him
But they could not stand
I thought uh oh
At that height every second counts and the other teams rushed past on their way to safety
I feel lucky today
If I take it I'm done for another year
That seems to be the ballpark we are in
If you do not wish to reveal that it your choice
It sounds like you have a lot of great opportunities
Startup prospects are I think more risky
Also I realize there are distinct advantages from living in Houston
I will forward this information
They paid on it last year
I think that is unique as well
In addition your family will not be trapped to one employer
In addition with the kind of money you will be making there is no state income in Texas
And being in the energy trading business it has no peer
To be honest I'm not a big buyer of Houston so I have to factor that into the equation
No matter what happens I appreciate you taking the time
We are having a pow-wow tomorrow afternoon and we should have something for you real soon after that
Just as a reference point what is the compensation package you have now and what are you expecting
Your meeting went really well everyone like you a lot
I was just wondering where we are at now
If you get a chance either e-mail me or give me a call
Sean how can we help you
If I can build a product I'm ready any time
We can test it internally before we go live
Let me know if I can build the product
This looks like it will work
This is how it should work
I suggest we test things out now and see how it works
I went to the NERC web site and sure enough Capacity Benefit Margin is a defined term
In fact one could very easily argue that they are VIOLATING this criteria
Attached is the memo I promised
Please feel free to utilize any or all of it
Your numbers are close enough to mine to agree
If there are any problems give me a call
Attached are my final comments
I don't care how you guys handle it
I originally thought that rotating between you guys might make sense
Let me know how you want to work it out
I will send you the P&L calculation a little later
Prior to that I cash traded for Portland General for a couple of years
The problem it seems to me is that fundamentally bid is always first offer is second
This seems too confusing to me
I'm not sure how you guys feel about it but I want to give you a heads up
Prior to that I performed more or less the same function with PGE for a couple of years
I'll give you a call
If not can you send me a revised version when you get a chance
If for any reason you cannot take this test by tomorrow please advise
Also if you have completed your test please let me know so I can update the UBS records
I agree with this
If there is some reason to keep it whole we have the length at COB
Let me know what we want to do
If there are additional transactions other than these I need to know within the next couple of hours
Per your request I have included the information on the BPA contracts
Too bad I didn't talk with you a little earlier
This sounds like a great job and ultimately I would be very interested
I have attached the job description I was telling you about
I agreed with the numbers on the spreadsheet
Sean thank you for your rent deposit yesterday
I really appreciate your timeliness
Is that ok with you
So long as we are able to deliver they will accept deliveries
Alan asked me to email this to you
They got it
As you know we rely heavily on them for transmission in the NW
I'm assuming this is OK Let me know otherwise
I understand you guys stole one of our marketers
That's ok I'll forgive you
Basically we are in a wait mode probably I think until February
So are you going to Europe
I hope everything is well with you
Please reply with your written confirmation
I am hoping that this message reaches all of you
Hopefully sometime in the future our paths will cross again
Happy Holidays to you and your families
The other person I was talking about is Diana Scholtes
If you have any questions let me or Diana know
I have seen it all now
Can you believe this
Do I go and drop him off or go
Hi Could you consider taking Nathan to Cub Scouts tonight
Becky thought it would probably only be
I closed out our Balance of February NW position
I'll have more detail to you and Thome in a minute
I run Enron's short-term Northwest book
Here is what we saw today
Let me know if it bogs down or anything
I'd like to get it done
I will update you on that when it happens
That should take care of it
I never thought it would happen to Enron
The question will become where are we going to be located
I realize it more and more since I came back
If you go there go to San Quirico Montecino and Montepulciano
Sounds like you are doing better
Do you miss the West
I don't think I'll live east of the Rockies but you never know
Well it looks like this year might be as interesting as last
I keep thinking things will mellow out a little but things keep getting more and more strange
I hope your okay over there on the west coast
If there's anything that I can do please let me know
Take care and please let me know if you need anything
There are some problems with your attachment
When are you sending this
Can you read the attached fact sheet for accuracy
Should we take this up with Bob Pease or since it was inadequate to begin with just forget it

If you could forward this on to her I would appreciate it

Any possibility of doing it on Monday

And I plan to be out there again real soon
I found a copy of what I'd sent to you before
I hope this is useful

I just found the best burrito place in the 'Loin
I'm adding my two cents
But a case for extra can still be made I think
Let me know if you have any issues with this treatment
No big deal we just need to make an assumption and go with it
I don't have any reservations with the content or format
Will have any comments to you pronto
You did a great job of pulling it together
Give it one final read through for final refinements
Any of these would give good exposure and likelihood of someone of your caliber getting in is pretty high
I am leaving town Wed not to return until Monday
I will be attending the press conference and will report back
Big question is is it included already
I don't think it's a huge deal though

Think about it no more
See you tonite
My word - you guys sure went all out
Best of course was having you all there

Generally when needed it will be subverted by exemptions for opportunity costs

She wants to edit it and try to send it out all at once

These performance reviews may push me right over the edge
Good talking to you earlier
Sounded like the Paul I know and admire
Looking forward to having you around more
Book your hotel room early
I don't know what the hell Cameron wants to do
She does want it to be the best it can be but it is ultimately not that important
I'd value it a lot
No big deal just wanted to let you know
And I'm having a field day filling out your review
I threw out the green shirt
Again he is not proposing these they are just options for the Governor
And count me in
Which entity do we license
Do we get CLEC licenses in all states or some strategic subset of states
Thanks sweetie and good luck on your midterm
Unfortunately when I was free he was in meetings and vice versa
So we never got to sit down and chat
I'll fill you in more soon
Thank you for the opportunity to provide our input
I can attest to the fact that you hit the bulls-eye dead center sir with your description

Please send me your feedback
Now you have to dig deeper and figure out which ones are the real players in this new economy
Here's my shot

Your thoughts on whether I achieved that objectvie are welcome
Sure this is just what you needed

If you would like to submit any items you may call me or send an e-mail message to me
Agree that we should decline to participate
Meeting will not be with Davis but with his staff
Williams got a letter but no info re their rep
I said we could have gotten a letter but I did not know
Thank you for your attention to this matter
Further we distance ourselves less likely we'll be cut in
I also pointed out the problems with price caps
I responded that I had no response
Please give me any feedback you have
Does anyone object to coordinating with them
We can't set a date til we know if they're available
And when do we need to regroup
I'll report by on my conversations with Mike
I'll take care of it
Have a great Thanksgiving with your family
It's a great pleasure doing business with you
I'll be in D.C Can't wait to see you
We had some fun and it would have been great to see you
Got your voice mail
Jeff thanks again for your help...btw what's your finders fee

Not sure where it will go but wanted to pass it along
I can't stand the noise those freakin' things make
I think that's it's a swell idea
I already got Cameron a garlic press
And I got her mom a spatula so don't go trying to preempt that gift too
Gray Davis because they lack the authority to do so
Individual bidders could still get higher >prices but would have to justify their claims to FERC

I am happy to take BART over but coming back is always a pain - as you know

Seriously it's been great discussing these issues on panels with you lately
Look forward to working on it
Hi Aleck How did your talk go
I hope well
Have you heard differently
See you on Friday
In any case just a thought that I wanted to share
Thanks and can't thank you enough for all your efforts
Hmmmm I think you're right
Looks like the more we can get done tonite the better
I will not have a lecture planned in advance
I suggest a quick conference call to discuss
Let me know and I'll set up a call-in number
Can you get this kind person the info
She has asked me to compile an address list of several of her colleagues including yourself
I will send out a real legislative report next week
If you have any questions or would like a copy of final legislation please call
If Paul's covering your time for the call I think it would be great for you to participate
I am attaching it here as it communicates the idea better
Dan Please join me in congratulating Sue on her selection
If you have any comments just give a holler
Can I get a copy of the full document
Is it ready yet
Could we talk today
Lets see if we can't get this info quickly
Marty and Jeremy are you available for a Wednesday morning call with Jeff Dasovich
How might they influence our actions with the existing contracts
Let me know if we need a broader discussion
I will participate by phone
I hope this helps frame the work

As you know Governor Davis appointed me to the California ISO last February
I'll let you know what I hear
Let me know and we can add them into our target CEO database
Also I left you Joe A
Joe A could you please send Joe K your contact numbers again
If there's anything else either of you need please don't hesitate to let me know
Could I get a contact # or email to intitiate contact
Thanks for your help once again
Alice -- can't make it
I have not heard from the others
Accommodations Because of the uncertain numbers it looks like getting a house to rent would not work
We can always cancel later if we have to
Going forward we are committed to working with Governor Davis and the State to implement his recovery plan
I've told her that I can't make it
Attached is a memo that presents the results of our assessment
Here are the spreadsheets that I mentioned in my prior e-mail
However I have tried to flag the places in the worksheets where there are plugged numbers rather than formulae
Gosh you guys are good
Luntz stuff is on its way
Let me know if that's a problem
Please make note of the new passcode on your schedules
Thanks and call me if you have any questions
Thanks for sending the doc back to me

She's a sweet dear friend of mine
Just want and need you to know
And please keep it very confidential
Thought you might like the compliment
Any chance you guys want to come along
Let me know if I can be of any help
They are selling themselves as a complete RFP and auction system
I wouldn't hand out any paper showing any analysis
How long would it take to refine
Jim's got it too
Let's do it
I'll do my darnedest to make it
Missed you lots in Colorado
If there are others who you think ought to participate please feel free to invite them
Jay I'm comfortable with our participation
I believe that it's an all-in price but I'll check
How soon can you answer this question
Please forward to whomever else needs it
Do you still want to keep the meeting
I am sorry to hear that you will be unable to meet next week but definitely understand
Actually it looks like my colleague Jeff Dasovich would not have been able to make it either
I will follow up with a call to him directly
I hope we can try to arrange another meeting soon
Greetings Richard When you get a moment please give me a call
I talked to Fossum before they wrote them
Unfortunately today it appears that the Committee has set a new course that radically departs from these previous commitments
Respectfully it would appear that the Committee has wandered far afield of its stated goals
The truth is he cannot although he has tried mightily
If only in this case he could have kept his critics in the dark
If only he had considered the accompanying stink
Since the governor is involved it seems apt to call it a cautionary tale
But by the time the spin doctors are through it may start to sound more like an urban legend
If however you feel that we can edit the exercises via email that's fine too
Seriously we can make it work if folks think that it makes sense
You should also ask Ian for a copy of his CV
I'd like to see his resume
I would want to see his CV
The UK DTI will keep paying him so he is effectively free to us
They want a relevant job/work experience for him
I would think challenging research attendance at settlement conferences some memo writing etc
I can get his CV when you need it
Power plant siting bill to follow if you'd like it
The attached version was older that we though
From you e-mail it is the latter I take it
Per our conversation here's a copy of the curves that need updating
If possible could you get them to me by tomorrow afternoon
Can you do that if I get you the rates
And thanks again for your efforts
Just let me know when you want to have the call
As you are likely aware like last time Enron's name won't be on the letter
Thank you Sue for helping out
Maybe they could take either of you out for lunch
I appreciate the efforts but I have questions about whether Enron's presence does more harm than it does good
Others may have a different view of it but I think that it needs to be consumers consumers consumers
Can we get a copy
Working on it
My friend Prentice Sellers will be picking my ticket up for me
As soon as we get a copy we will forward it
As you may know TURN ultimately decided not to participate
For whatever reasons there is nothing like an intractable social and political problems to get me interested
Do we know for how long a decision will be delayed
Finally he is very interested in seeing the CA LDC rates unbundled
Unless someone has a different view I think that we're all on the same page and ready to go
In that regard you should have received via fax of the language that Sher has put together
I propose the following
I know that this is a very long shot
If we touch the system once we pay the whole surcharge
I read through the proposed legislation
As you know I'm in the negotiations
Whether California can execute on it is another story
But we're trying damned hard to make it happen
IEP should support it
I would appreciate your feedback
Finally it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill
And if that's the case would it make sense to delete that language from the bill
Don't know if he'll do it
Hertzberg said he talked to K Lay yesterday
Were you aware
Thanks for you comments
I did this prior to the meeting w/Keeley yesterday
I agree with you re amend
You thinking you mite be awake this time
Will you wear the shirt
I think the camera loves it
When and if I do any updates to smaller groups
I'll put you on those too
You can send both but I'd have folks keep it close to the vest
It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press list he said
Davis is fighting disclosure of state power purchases saying it would compromise negotiations for future contracts
I will set-up if you don't already have something going
And it will just suck if you're not there
See you on Sunday with language on Direct Access
Howdy If Dorothy sent something I haven't received it
Really appreciate it
I'll leave you a message should anything come up
Hope they do better tomorrow than they did today
See you later today
He has refused to name his donors and did not return a call for comment yesterday
Will do so immediately and get you a copy
I'm continuing to work on it
Did you guys put a bid i= n
ISO Allen Can you guys continue to put the price at that
They were faking it
ISO Allen I appreciate it
ISO Hey Ryan its Allen
ISO Allen Hey did you put it in for the next hour
ISO Allen If you have any questions let me know
Folks Here are my edits
For simplicity I accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline
California will sue to get the rest he said
What they care about is a witch hunt
Thanks Barbara Dorothy just phoned me and I believe we're all squared away
Can you call her and make sure that you're comfortable
Jeff-can you come up with something clearer
I talked to Dorothy and we're square
Also let me throw this out
Have you considered opening presents and having dinner at your place
Might be nice to do it in the city and we'd be happy to host it there too
Great to see you and Prentice on T-day
Be great if you stopped by
Just let me know when you're going to be here
If not I think that you should be
Be great if you got involved
Hope all is well with you and yours
Could you please forward to Bev
Interviewers weren't buying his BS at all
But we haven't discussed any reason for needing it
As such given the last-minute nature of the change it should be deleted
Don't know if it differs from the one distributed yesterday
If we don't get all of it from the commission.?.?
He depleted our budget surplus
Glad you can make it
Something's wacky with your server
And you are indeed awesome MRS Hunter
Could you forward to me the final
If in the end there ain't nothing useful so be it
But seems like there's little downside to exploring it
I'm working on it but it's going to require quite a bit of work
In addition seems that the letter would benefit from a bit more editing to make it shorter
Apologies that it took so long
Just sent it
Talk to you in a couple minutes
Here's the final with the changes that we discussed incorporated
Steve give it one last quick read I made a few other minor editorial comments
Thanks very much for you help on this
At this point yes that's sort of how I feel about it
Better or worse than ours
Got your and Fran's messages
Ken Smith just called my attention to the following
Did you know CallWave has a great NEW FREE SERVICE available
But I really need a way for my family to reach me while I'm on-line
To view your fax please click on or download the attached file
Attached is their analysis
Nice work if you can get it
You keep one but must give the other to your neighbor
The government takes both and provides you with milk
The government takes both and sells you the milk
The government takes both then shoots you
Thanks.Glad to hear it
You got it
You get my voicemail on your cell phone
I faxed the signature pages and service list
I also faxed the entire document
In a nut shell here are the problem areas in the bill as he sees it
If any questions let me know
California takes it in the chin from the FERC judge
Wanted you to see it
Thank you SO much
However it is still unclear if that is enough the commissioners said
I can make time
Just let me know when you'd like to talk
More info to follow as we get it
If you have quesitons comments or suggestions for additional research needed just holler
Please forward to others who might need it

I also support Tamara's desire to reconcile at a tariff level the curves to actual utility bills
Please let her know once a final order is issued
Talk with you soon
Seemed that Wanda from her note said that she is on top of it
Here's the note that I sent yesterday
Let me know if you get this one
Mike Please make sure that Paul and Sue and I get on these notes
Can you track down this bill and determine impact
If there is a chance that it moves we need to discuss the effect of this bill
Mike I understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on behalf of Questar
Do we know if pipelines generators large customers are supporting or opposing the bill
I think the draft looks good
However now that it is moving they have got the message
I am hopeful that other groups will surface soon
As for the bill itself the problem is two fold
If they don't take this they can only get interruptible service from the utilities
Please call if you have further questions
You know where they are
Have you heard from Harry or Jim S or Parquet
Call me on my cell or page me after you meeting this afternoon and let's discuss
We will call you on thurs a.m Can you please verify your contact phone number
Trying to get a handle on it
Mr Davis says his actions will ensure that Californians have a secure supply of reasonably priced electricity
I would get out tomorrow if you would let me out
As its name implies the ISO was supposed to manage the grid without favoring any one participant
Since then he hasn't been bashful about exercising his emergency powers
Mr Davis has said he doesn't have any plans currently to take such an action
Mr Davis says his actions have been essential and are working
Then if they spent too much the PUC could make their shareholders take a hit
Still she voted for the bill that gave the executive branch carte blanche to make those huge commitments
Most including us oppose unless significantly amended
What time do you need it
And can I just email it to you
It constantly adds new products to its trading arsenal
Dear John You're opening my flood gates and I'm going to refrain from getting entirely upset
Please read the attached letter which is the one that we sent to Dunn last week
I owe ya
Nothing more yet from the CPUC on its intended action
If there's anything I can do to assist on the request from Chambers just let me know
Trade you energy for broadband
Can you page me and let me know your take
Have you seen this
Attachment A the proposed rate agreement is being forwarded to you as a separate PDF document
That is music to my ears
Can't tell you how much you're help is valued
How would you like to handle
I was going to do it but now have to go so fucking Sacramento
I don't recall agreeing to any of this
As best I can figure Reliant's included
Could you summarize for me precisely what she'd like to discuss
Let me know what time you would like to do it
Scott Can you try to find me bios of these folks
Understand what you need
Sue Mara my colleague in the SF office will join the call

Not sure how our decisionmaking is taking place
Please let me know if Enron is interested in protesting
It kills it period
I sure hope that ARM is seriously opposed to the bill
And to add insult to injury the State Power Authority may be their partners in crime
Burton has said it is this bill or nothing
Please comment on my above analysis
I would love to be wrong on this one
In the Assembly two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change their bill
I would say I'm tentatively satisfied
Hope all's well with you and yours
The bill creates an option to buy the transmission system but rejects the Goernor's MOU which buys it outright
The Assembly also has not passed its version of an Edison MOU which it says it intends to do
I think that there's only a hard copy and I've got one that I can copy for you
The letter to your plastic surgeon looks very good
The Dunn report responsible for our stock hit today
Gray Davis' rhetoric and some of his actions during the energy debacle have only added to the impression
Do we believe the state government could make those investment decisions wisely efficiently and devoid of politics
However our current woes should remind us not to take economic growth for granted
Hope this helps any questions just let me know
Greetings Looks like our respective sources are tracking pretty well
The Assembly must pass the budget before they can recess
This was a significant event while you were gone
You should look it over so you know what's out there
Would be interesting to contrast with our recent FERC filing
Boy would I like to come to Houston
Soon as I get to Houston I'll look you up and we can compare notes
Got the voice mails of all my contacts
Greetings Left you a voicemail
On another note CDWR has announced its revenue requirements going forward
And it has become in turn a whipping boy for California politicians
Some of it is just buzzword politics
I just found this note
We request no gifts just your presence
Thanks and please call if you have any questions
I'm on her list
Well hey there to you
What the heck you doing there
How's your summer
I do not like the south bay much
Trying to get a happy hour together in August...are you around
I'm sending this directly to your mother Scott
Please just let it end
It was bought for you
It is the only life you have ever known
If a Bush said it was so it was so
Bizarre as it sounds we've now heard that they are calling the Assembly members back
If the bill passes it may go straight to the Assembly floor that night
However I don't ever recall you agreeing with every Commission decision on disallowances
I just hope that this isn't the tip of the iceberg
A Republican yes but I haven't heard anyone else describe him as a dim bulb
I don't think my memory has gotten that bad
From the most recent proposal released today by the Assembly leadership it appears that the centrist Democrats are prevailing
Upon an initial read it appears that they are doing the following:
Having printed the paper I found out that the file received only contains half the paper
Worse the authors seemed to have left a page out of the document they distributed
While Leslie was out I had a brief discussion with Tycholiz et al
SHould we try again or have you already discussed
We can try him tho
In fact I will cc both Sue and Jeff on this
Sue Here's my shot at it
Please add subtract multiply as you see fit
I was on the list
Do you have any materials that describe SoCal's current windowing procedure
Hertzberg and I are trading calls
Will report back as soon as I hear anything
Loretta believes the only authority the Commission has is when to suspend DA not whether to suspend it
Scott said that it bounced back to him the first time
TJ I'll pick up my ticket on Monday so please don't give it away
Could you please forward it
Consider yourself blessed
Most of the consultants for example failed to state when they bought the energy stocks
I guess it's just politics and we're the pawns
If he or she refuses the state will sever its contract with that person
If OK with you I'would love to crib from it for New York on Friday
Rick asked that I forward this to you
Do you know who will be in the audience
And how many folks we are expecting
Also if there are specific things that you folks want/don't want me to say please let me know
I can't open it
Governor Davis noted that in the decade prior to his administration no power plants were built in the state
I have made reservations for Jeff
Does he have a couple of other choices
Besides it made sense to be up to speed on the issues
I should have figured you should have been on the list
She would remember me at least
If you ever need to explore this contact let me know
Otherwise I am glad to let sleeping dogs rest
Might be interesting for you to contact her
I'll call you tomorrow if you're around
Folks since many law firms have failed to exit the dark ages they continue to use wordperfect
Staying at the W When and where would you like to hook up
Since I get everything that you forward you may remove me from you distribution list
He says that by the sound of it my property just might end up being vine-friendly
However I will nonetheless get a draft of the letter out today for discussion on tomorrow's call
Given the glitch it will likely be out by COB today
Under terms of the open order he said he had no control over the exact date of purchase
ISO staffers decline to discuss the situation in detail saying it involves confidential bidding behavior
I have another question
It will have all the information on it
No matter how much Davis points the finger Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad policies
Looks like one thing good has happened for them today
I don't think Maviglio will be able to stay
I'm glad he made some money off of Enron stock
Also we did file the amended complaint yesterday and the motion to quash will be filed today
Hope to talk to you soon
I do plan on coming every Thursday to the group meetings
I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate
Now she says she is starting to look elsewhere
PS We had not idea that Maviglio owned our stock
Looks like I'm going nonetheless things I can do up there
I need to cancel your tickets then
Would you let me know
For those of you who had planned on attending I am sorry to cause you this inconvenience
As these changes occur I will communicate this information to you
Any questions or concerns please contact me
If you would like to modify the agenda please send your edits to me
Hi Mike Parquet found me to talk about the QF ideas that you guys are bouncing around
Any help you two can provide would be greatly appreciated
Hope to see you both real soon
Let me know if you have a set meeting schedule
I have reserved Mt
Bear with me
I want to work on it through the evening
Did you get the faxes I sent
Otherwise it'll land in your email later tonite
Man there must be a lot of bad hair out your way with that kind of heat
So here we are
I think either solution is fair to both sides
Thank you and I mean this sincerely for considering our request for a revision of the billing arrangements
With that in mind I believe that it's important to honor the arrangement
If you'd like to discuss it further I'd be happy to talk about it
Maybe I'll see you tonight
Are you available on Monday
Feel free to modify as you see fit
And I agree with Ralph re staying focused on the most urgent issues
I hope to join the next meeting whenever it is
I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the good luck continues
If we don't talk between now and Thursday we'll talk then
Not sure that you were on the email list for this
I think at this point any more changes and we're going to blow our collective brains out
Tell me that it doesn't matter please
I'll keep my fingers and toes crossed
Haven't read it yet
Did you guys like it
Got your message re reverse auction all of the utility's demand
But they may find themselves without a choice
Will let you know where it goes
Jessie Knight called me
Know it's a long shot but figured it don't hurt to try
Please tell me that I am
Also I clicked on deferral enrollment and by-golly if I couldn't find the election form to download
Am I just clueless or is there another place that I need to look for it
However we haven't done so yet
I think that you're wondering is right on target
So this represents our best shot
If there's anything else just let me know
Thank you so much
Really sorry to bother you so much
Mary - can you help Jeff with his deferral enrollment
He apparently does not have that piece on his eHRonline
Here they are
Anyway that's it
Thanks SO much for pulling it together
I'm on your man
What do you need
Can one of you call in
As far as how a response would help us in California I think requires a discussion with Jeff
When we have our understanding straight let's talk
In my opinion this ad captures our message very well
Based on the group's comments which were significant we have developed an entirely new ad
If we do not hear from you we will assume you are fine with the ad as is
Thank you for all of your help
Obviously any other ideas you have will be welcomed
Determine our view of how to treat term contracts w.r.t
Someone told me that there's an article in last Thursday's
Have you seen it
If so could you forward
If not could you try and find it and forward
I saw the piece on the local news
It was very clear that you were taken horribly out of context and they did you a great disservice
You can imagine just how sensitive we are to that issue
But I don't think that you should sweat it
Appreciate your note
Let me try to fill in the blanks
The risk you take in any situation like this
I disagreed with that conclusion yesterday and this morning
I responded that would also be a mistake
The source of potential allegations against Enron isn't me
If I can clarify anything else let me know
I probably will have several opportunities to influence him if necessary
Thank you very much for the info
Please call if you have any immediate questions
California needs real one-stop shopping and it needs it now
Per my voice message to you yesterday
A copy of the ruling is attached for your information.
He based his recommendation on the fact that microturbines are small quiet efficient and very versatile
Also please let me know if my notes w.r.t
If there's anything you need between now and Monday please let me know
Well you two really raised the bar with that celebration
I will call Mom and Dad
I don't think that the discussions will be ending very soon
Clearly the biggest mistake California made was neglecting to establish a retail market in its restructuring legislation
I believe that on Thursday/Friday
Darned if I can find it
Could you resend it
What did we hear from FERC last week
I ain't forgot

Again thanks in advance for your participation
I promise to give you more notice next time
You'll have a chance to buy me at least one meal
As far as I know I do no have media clearance so I had no comment
I don't want to create an hassles
I'll be ready to discuss it at the meeting too
The power companies can send out their bloated bills but the tanned masses won't pay
For the first time Americans feel the bite of real globalization and we don't like it one bit
The more we educate folks the more they agree with our views and positions
It's an opportune time to communicate our messages
That would work for me
Will let you know
Let me know so I can pass along to Marathon
Can you facilitate this
Also Frank said that he does not have a copy of the focus group video
Can you obtain a copy for Rich
Did you have a good time at the dome
Could you forward this along to him
If you have any questions please page me
Can we do a little planning tonite for this weekend
Can you email to your invites
Did you invite John E
Tam then when you hit Highway One make a right and head north toward town
If you see the lagoon on your left you've gone too far
If you arrive in the town of Stinson Beach you've gone too far
I'm faxing the final to you
I need to know how many beds there are total
I'll read and get back to you

He just can't help himself
Can you please explain
Looks fine to me to send around
You want to send it
Give a call when you get a chance to discuss
That's the information that they sent me copied from what they sent me
I don't have time
I don't see how you get the numbers
The group liked our portfolio approach
If there are any questions etc. just let me know
Munis and Florio were not on the call today but I suspect both will be OK with our proposal
I asked for a confirmation but have not received one yet
I got Lysa's phone mail so I don't know if she is there or not
The world is no longer safe not even for we relics
Being a true blue American I support expansion
If you get a free minute can you give me a call to discuss
I'll get you my comments ASAP
Has Shelley Corman seen it
I could pick it up
I'm thinking we need two cases
That consistent with what your hearing
Thanks for keeping us in the loop
I feel so useless
Are you in close contact with Martin and Doug
Though I'm sure it doesn't seem like it I'm on the job
Please include her on everything too
I'll come look for you later
Here is what I sent out just a few minutes ago
I can't find him in the Enron Corp
When would you like to talk re Mr Bray
A lady from FERC just called me to let me know
They were clueless but promised to call me back
Do we want an Enron representative on the panel
That's what consumers themselves face
Do we have any
Have we had to file any elsewhere
Ain't seen the joint resolution thought my in-box is a mess
Did you send that around
I really appreciate your help here
Did you get my message
What time are you done with class
I believe that Jeff's suspicions are dead on
Will keep you apprised of events as they occur
I can wait a little bit
Would you rather wait or take Bart
All kidding aside I wish you all the best with your procedure tomorrow
With both of us trying to dig up a copy we're sure to find one
And you made with mom & dad
That's scary about Annie- I guess she is OK now
I did not hear about the announcement - please send

And of course if there is ever anything I can do for you do not hesitate to contact me
If I'm going to be later than that I'll leave you a message on your work voicemail
Right now I'll try to find a place where my phone works so I can call you
Getting you the info by the end of the week or sooner will not be a problem
If possible it would be very beneficial to have your input by then
I will keep an eye out for the filing
Citizens recently announced a possible rate increase due to higher charges from its energy supplier Arizona Public Service Co
Lara I have rather hastily put this list together
For that I apologize
Hope it is helpful
With that power they can influence PX prices
If you have any questions or if there's anything else I can do to help don't hesitate
Sent you info for u & Rick
I will be at the FERC hearing on Tuesday
You like me to fill you in on what transpires
However the bill is still on file for concurrence so we will monitor
As you know I have great interest
However I've checked flight schedules to come out Tuesday night and to put it mildly it's very ugly
If time permits we can also have a substantive discussion of the issues
Lysa once we have a head count please get us a meeting room and breakfast
What are our specific business interests in California
What are the forums we expect will affect our business interests
For each forum how do we want to posture Enron
Do we want to be the most aggressive company
Do we want to act alone
Do we want to work only in coalitions
What will motivate us to act independently
What is our overall strategy
For example re the legislature do we want to identify legislation that we will seek affirmatively
Besides I owe you a beer
Also I met today with Bowen & Co re interconnection
I'll email it around
If we have the documents in hand great
But given the witch hunt figured we'd sit back and let things run their course
We should bide our time for now but tell the guys in the server farms to gear up
I want to apologize in advance
I'll let you know what FERC decides when it decides it
I have inherited this
I vote yes
Let me know if this date works
I felt proud not betrayed
I have started to look at the case assignment for Monday
Since I will be out of town the following week I will volunteer to write this one up
Let me know how we want to handle this
What time do you go on
When I get the list I'll forward it
My apologies in advance if I vent somewhat
Briefly some of you know that I attended Berkeley's Policy School
From my perspective the effort turned out to be a rather big disappointment
I urge us not to get involved or contribute $$s
At this juncture I would recommend against having Ken Lay participate
If anyone would like to discuss my reasons in more detail I'd be happy to discuss
Ralph is no longer with us
He likes Enron and has been trying to get us to pay him for some work for some time
No need for it here in the UK but I would use him in emerging markets given the opportunity
Let me have your thoughts at your earliest convenience
I have no other commitments in the US at that time.
I did in fact aprticipate in that along with Kyran Hanks
I should be interested to hear from you on retail competition.
Hope it is helpful please call if I can be of any assistance
I do plan on accompanying Steve
Steve you want me to bring the copies
Jeff will you accompany Steve
I have five minutes

I don't have anyone to go with me
You asked that we attempt to evaluate our activities
Be happy to discuss with you further
Hey sounds like life in Bay Watch is treating you well
I may miss both Monday and Tuesday
I think it's your turn to organize
If I can handle it I want an early graduation
I'm going to forward you a bunch of stuff starting with this
Hope you and yours are doing well
Thank you all for your help in finalizing the document
We should decide how we want to handle
If we're called on to discuss do we simply discuss orally some sort of simplistic PP slides spreadsheets other
Anyway to discuss between now and Monday or do we want to just take Dylan up on his offer
I will take a look at the case tonight
Divvying is fine with me
If there's other stuff you need or if you'd like to discuss don't hesitate
Kim's stuff looks pretty good to me
I can do the write-up for next week
I will not be in class Mon or Tues
Jeff can you hand the case in
In terms of format since there is no guidance I say we do it however we want
If we're called on to discuss do we simply discuss >orally some sort of simplistic PP slides spreadsheets other
And as I mentioned I'd be happy to write that one up
I leave for S.D
I'll give you updates as the day transpires tomorrow
Or maybe who could tell me
Didn't receive your attachements
Did you just modify those or create a new document
I will print it out and bring it to class
Please let me know if you agree
The FERC Commissioners seemed somewhat responsive to my concerns
Edwards resigned her post on the ISO Thursday

For my part please feel free to forward along any articles
I can be on the call
I can get you in
Don't let me down man

Who is your contact
I would not be inclined to sign the letter

We will be scheduling our next general meeting for mid October
Kim in your absence on Monday we talked a little about how to proceed on the next case
I have randomly selected questions here are the results
If folks are comfortable with this distribution let me know
Team My Haas e-mail is forwarded to my work e-mail
Sorry I let you down on the first case
I am happy to report that those measures have been adopted although not without considerable resistance from self-interested parties
Subsequent behavior of wholesale electric prices during August confirms their conclusions and subjects California to further economic damage
Covisint can't blame it on the government anymore
It hasn't finalized yet where its headquarters will be
And perhaps most important it has yet to hammer out exactly what technology it will run on
Covisint insists it can't even begin operations in the U.S until it gets the go-ahead from that agency
Forgive the length but it was a long couple of days
Hopefully it hits the highlights and gives a good flavor
Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions
In fact I don't think Tim will want to sell the SDG&E zone at all
Am I correct in my thinking
On your issue of CPUC approval that is exactly the play
While the rate deal was broader we could just supply this customer group
I'll call when we have the information
With this structure we could offer a fixed price equal to the weighted average price of their load profile
Since they can't make money on commodity at least they don't want to lose money
Maybe we could get the approval of the CPUC
If someone could get me that load profile information I would be willing to price it up
However it can be done
I love you tons and hope you understand
Please call your mom
I love you tons
And if you want to talk more about dinner please call me
Are they gouging San Diegans

Due to SAP configuration the system will not deduct any taxes from his pay until the total is refunded
When's your anniversary
It is not a command performance but you are most welcome.
That said I concur that it ain't a gimmee
I will due my best on the Thursday deadline but I am pretty fried at present
I should be able to focus on this tomorrow eve
I am happy to take on the assigned question

We should be using it for the OII filing

It is not a command performance but you are most welcome=
The Administration advised that if the situation warrants they will indeed issue the Order
Ralph No one else had any problems with it
The hearings were tiresome but hanging out with you and Steve was a real treat
Hope to do it again soon
I personally think that the big ticket items are rate level rate freeze end and TRA allocation
I wish we could start facing that dance
I think it's vital that you attend
Maybe you could ask the other folks on the distribution to urge Dan to come too
But first thank you very much again for meeting last week
I will update you tomorrow on the group's progress
Have you been there
It is not a command performance but you are most welcome
Here's the release that I referenced yesterday evening
Since I'm in S.F. I assume that I'll be able to call in by phone
And the same to you
Sorry you didn't make to have a beer after the final
See you at MPAR in January
I have my fingers crossed that a Republican administration will help
Thus my heavy-handed edits on that portion
Here's where the group I mentioned left off last Friday
It will be useful for our discussion this afternoon
Particularly we discussed much greater detail around the rate stabilization plan than is reflected in the attached outline
Thank you all again for your efforts
Can we try to set up a quick call to discuss
Do you have any thoughts on what worked what did not
I sent a note to everyone I contacted advising the call would not take place
Mike Can't thank you guys enough for coming
It was a great time and Prentice was really happy that you made it
Great to have you
If I hear anything I'll report back
I've attached it
Alan could you see if it's included in the decision
If not I can poke around more
However I think Mike is struggling to justify a smaller haircut
Gray Davis hasn't seen fit to replace them
However the sources said both sides are digging in their heels as the talks intensify
It demonstrates that you're one talented guy yourself
Your show was great and it was good to see you
In the flurry I accidentally deleted it
Could you re-send
Will get back with more as it develops

I don't have it
The company has four hotels in California three of which buy their power from SDG&E
If there's anything else that you need don't hesitate
I forgot about Sandi's vacation
Since the press will likely have the place surrounded they may decide to do that item first
Are we following developments in this area

More info as it becomes available
Are you available after Wanda's call

I'll see the rest of you on the beach
We look forward to answering your questions and receiving your feedback
In the meantime we extend our best wishes for a safe and happy holiday season
Mike Day our outside counsel will make the presentation on our behalf
In general we should not be overly prescriptive at this point and I know you agree with that
Otherwise I think you have captured the points excellently
I don't think these will are appropriate at these hearings
Common themes--many tracked ours pretty closely Not a question of whether rates need to rise but by how much
We're doing everything necessary to preserve our appeal rights
I know you have a lot going on with many to communicate with / to
Needless to say given the Governor's press release I'm a little concerned about what he might want
I haven't received anything
So far Williams is the only IEP member company participant I have heard about
We need to talk it over
And that their liquidity problem is contrived or at least overstated

Yes if you do not take into account the rate base impact
The Legal Issue In general our proposal seems to have gotten some traction
Whether it sticks remains to be seen however

If that poses a problem for anyone please let me know
Steve I'm going to give you a call
Few things Got your message
Let me know if you think it works
Yes have talked to both Stoness and Sunde about it
Apparently he was trying to schedule a meeting with Clinton and our meeting conflicted so we were bumped
This they told us is the marketplace
Now the utilities look for a way to repackage their old proposal including a substantial rate increase
I was literally just about to call the Portland desk
You saved me the trouble
Apparently the ISO put out another list and we're on it
I didn't realize that the Portland office only does power sales
I'll let you know if I find out anything more
Lamentably I worked all week--no vacation time
I had a great time and it was fun spending it with you two
When I think of all that talent together in one house astounding
I haven't forgotten the QF issues
Going to weave them into our comments on the Governor's proposals

It was good to talk to you last night

Thanks again for your help on this

Is Dave Parquet attending for us
I have also attached the Final FAQ and Glossary of Terms
Well hope your holiday was great because I'm back with more questions
They're on their way
As you can imagine the distribution list has almost reached the size of the entire company

If there's anything at all that we can do to help please don't hesitate to ask
Hope it turns out that your guts are in good order
I'm feeling like I could use a transplant myself
I think you're entitled to continue on if that's your decision
You may not have the attendance you prefer but I don't oppose moving the Gas Accord talks forward
Actually these days I feel like I could use a vacation myself
Greetings and Happy New Year to you both
Best to you and yours in the New Year
Per your request I am writing a brief note to follow up on our telephone conversation today
You asked me to discuss whether this was possible
Apologies for bothering you over the weekend
Attached are my updates to Steve's backgrounder and solutions documents
Governor Davis suggested that if necessary he would consider far stronger measures
In return he said the producers would guarantee that the power would be sold within the state
You've got my vote
If you have any comments or changes please let me know so I can route a final version
I'll do my darnedest
Could you please forward me the call-in for the call
Harry I'll be on the call and I'll call you beforehand
Sorry to hear that it was cancelled
Thank you for keeping me in the loop
In any event I don't see the downside to having Mike do the testimony
If we can make this work I'm all for it
Re why can't we just say no
I can understand our reluctance in putting an Enron person on the stand so maybe we shouldn't
Why not pay an economics consultant like Robert Michaels to represent us
ALso he's just joined TCA so we could easily use him
As for the invitation to speak my thought is that we ask Mike Day to speak on our behalf
The issue we have been asked to address is very generally supply and demand
Could you please see that Sandi gets this
Karen - We believe its going to be John Burton
Monday's a day off for me
Nothing wrong with being comfortable in your birthday suit
When should we talk
Am I smoking crack on the whole idea
Where should we have it
I think it should not be at our house in Napa but someplace a little more special
Sorry for surprising you this morning
However I don't know if you have any interest in Eastern European projects
However what are your thoughts/suggestions
Although the only company she named was AES she made every committee member believe it was everyone
As you mentioned it's quite inefficient to have EES folks contacting our lawyers and reg consultants directly
Jan and//or Katie and I have been attending these meetings
Many of the Democrats have demonstrated extreme caution are interested in our message but offering little or no support
Because this meeting list was changing on an hourly basis it was impossible to forward to Board members
Of course I'd love to hear that I made if off the waiting list
Could it be true
Could you let me know
If you have any suggestions or questions please don't hesitate to write us at IzioSupport@convene.com
Mike Could you please forward a copy of the document listed below to Ms Cantrell
Can you provide a little more information like date or who filed
I agree with Harry
Let me know if you want to pursue this further
Was that you
Were you at Tom's
I spaced it
Or TW can call him directly
It was a pleasure to see you again today
So far I have no other scheduled meeting= s or hearings for next week
For the renewables it is more of a fixed payment approach
I'll give you a call this week
Best to you and yours
I would think you could sign most of San Diego
When and if you decide to reenter the market we have some ideas we'd like to discuss
I will try to make the next meeting
How would you structure it differently next time
I really apologize but is there any way you could talk to Keith
As you might imagine the California crisis is receiving substantial media coverage in the region
In particular it's being used by opponents of deregulation to bolster their position
Ain't talked to him
If you need anything don't hesitate to contact me
Thanks again for your efforts
And she agreed to send the proposal to Summers today
May not go anywhere but I told them that I'd be happy to review it
I will be a Project Manager in the Information Services department
They also suggested that DWR should at their discretion be able to assume certain existing contracts
I see I inadvertently omitted you from the first e-mail
I talked to Phil
He's got an editor that he works with who can help
She'll call me back as soon as she talks to him
We'll see how long they can sustain this position
Rick and I will be meeting with Ed Gillespie Wednesday a.m We should know more then
Though I didn't have a problem with the course agenda I'm comfortable with the alternative
Let me know your preference
To also confirm you indicated WA as the first priority state with Scott overseeing
Susan I'm not ignoring you
Jeff How's married life treating you
Sue can you handle
We can fill you in on the details re IBM over the phone
I'm going to go ahead and send it to her
In response to your question yes Edison did file in federal district court in L.A
Thanks and I appreciate your response
This is what we are aware of as of today
I'll be sending mine around later this afternoon
Miss you guys terribly
Don't throw me out of the club for being AWOL please
Hope to see you soon
For more than a week the California Independent System Operator has kept its highest alert in place
In exchange the state would sell revenue bonds that repay past spending and finance power purchases on their behalf
Craver also stressed that Edison the parent of the utility hasn't gone into default on its obligations
I would recommend that they do not sign
I've done my best to include your very helpful comments.
A number of you have already indicated you would sign it.
Also Tom Campbell has indicated he will try to recruit Ken Arrow.
I believe one of you agreed to recruit Dan McFadden.
Many thanks for your involvement and endorsements
I don't envy your position
She's really working it which is great and I continue to focus my efforts there
My company is squarely behind her efforts
Reply Separator I took a look at the case last night
I would vote we go for it
But we haven't received the file yet
Could you possibly forward it to us
Tyson said based on her conversations with Summers he's squarely on board
Jim please let me know if you receive this
I'd be happy to talk with them about excess capacity
And consider this the data will be available to her in six months anyway
Without the data she can't say anything conclusive
I have one question
She said she could
Tell me what we should do and tell me quickly
I have never been accused of being subtle
I am writing this note to you and not the committee
You know we will be attacked after we issue the manifesto
However under such circumstances we would all be poor
I fall into this later category as I believe do a number of other individuals
I'll give you a call in the morning
I will forward the press release in the morning
I haven't had the benefit of Kim's answer but made some assumptions and took a shot
I am very positively inclined as a result of these bids
This as you know is at least a three corner billiards shot it may be more difficult than that
He has subsequently been the CEO of Smith Barney and he has years of experience in the utility business
Everyone has mentioned the three component parts -- Native Generation QF's and what we call the net short
As I said I want to protect the integrity of the bid process
It could be in a week it could be shorter
Obviously yes the answer is yes you do need it
Do you understand what I'm saying
I recommend not filing
Let me know by VOICE MAIL what you want to do
This proposal may be to our benefit or to our detriment
Certainly we need to evaluate this in light of other developments
Give me a call with any questions
Will pass on more info as we get it
Jeanne please have Mike give me a call to discuss
If we had to undertake it how long would it take to get a product
Thanks and feel free to call if you have any questions
Check it out
Or are we still making changes
When can we get the final final final for further distribution
I can't keep track of all the distribution lists
Please let me know if you receive
Could you please copy us on the UI details
I've listed specific requests for several people but am copying many more of you for your input as well
Anything you can provide by sometime on Monday will be appreciated
Any insight you can provide regarding the rules the current climate what would fix the current situation etc
Was it required through legislation or the CPUC and what exactly does it mean
They have indicated that they intend to keep repower peakers and new generation issues separate in separate bills
I have that right
This tracks very well with my chat with Barbara
Per your request I talked to Jeff yesterday early evening
I had been in a meeting with Keeley Wright et al after the hearing
OK Jimmie and I duplicated effort just a bit
I will look at the data some more tomorrow
I'm a believer in markets and I think the notion of deregulation is basically sound
Why would I have figured that
Regrettably I'm on travel in New York City today and can't make it to class this evening
Thanks a million for all your efforts
Sorry I didn't get back to you last week
I spoke with Lynn Schenk on Thursday
Thank you and see you next week
Please make appropriate arrangements with your team members
He is seeking our comments and possible endorsements
Anyway I'm not sure if I'm thinking straight on this but that's how I read the numbers
Anyway I may not have this right but thought I'd bring it up to see what you think
I can do a conference all today if folks would like
Should we try and co-ordinate a conference call
Jeff did you hear from teacher if OK to join
We will provide a draft to them tomorrow morning
We will advise you of any other major developments
We have written this up before I think we just need to put it in letter form
Dave I think your memo to me is a good start
I think we should send a response from Ken
Jeff Mark can you send across what you have
No I don't think I'd make a better accountant
But I did ask a few questions of my accountant brother-in-law
I guess you would make a better accountant than me
Jeff will you forward to Sandi and lobbyists after review
Please address comments to Jeff and myself
Please comment on these as well if you can
Thanks in advance for your fast turnaround on this
I haven't read this yet so I don't know if it's good bad or indifferent
If folks have comments please forward them along and I will get them into the mix
Although this statement is in my own words I believe it is consistent with the Manifesto
I will try to incorporate suggestions in the next draft
Thanks for your reaction
I forwarded this information to Joe Lyons in Rod Wright's office
Hi Hope you had a nice weekend
Sorry I missed you all in Washington
Rick's asked me to attend the meeting at the Woodlands tomorrow
Do we have a list of attendants/agenda
No big deal but would help me in preparing for the meeting
The Governor hired Peevey to be his chief energy advisor
Ken Lay told them that Enron would respond
Response from Peevey He agreed but said that it was impossible to remove it from the bill
Jim Got your message
I wanted to follow-up with everyone following yesterday's meeting
But he miscalculated on both
What did we do to the facts
We haven't been to the PUC about re-sourcing our customers
Do you have any intelligence about this
I thought you ought to know
We talk periodically and we always end up talking about bluegrass
He really wants us to go to this camp
It's not bluegrass oriented enough for me but it is interesting
This looks too cool - wish I could go this year
Nice chatting with you today
For me one dance per night was enough thank you
Was it the communal urge
Some teens never seem to turn up at their parents campsites
Devout fiddlers went off to their Irish or Greek Cape Breton gypsy Yugoslav
They had their plan and they stuck to it
What else did I learn from camp
Next year I will work it into my schedule
I liked that
We were exhilirated focussed and leveled to our highest common denominator
Camp dust settled on us all equally
Maybe we've forgotten how much fun it is to entertain ourselves
How many am I allowed to get
Hope to see you guys soon
I will check and get back to you
Do we have anything on this
Let me know if you need additional information
We should be able to pull it together
Mike I don't have any information about siting or DSM bills
As a result the UDCs will not bill customers for penalties nor track them for potential future payment
But if they don't there will be no penalty
If you have any quesitons about the order give me a call
Would anyone be interested in me setting up such a meeting for next week say Wednesday or Thursday
And if that's not enough I don't have conferencing capability from home
We are continuing to perform on our existing contracts with PG&E
Can we set a time on Wednesday to discuss this live
The Bush administration insists it will not extend the order
We're not waiting for someone to throw us a long pass
We're going to solve it ourselves
In contrast its parent company Edison International is paying all of its bills
Chris I'll have the summary to you shortly
Steve Kean asked that I forward it along to you
Told him the proposal is on his fax machine
He thanked me and said he'd get back to us
Two other suppliers agreed they would continue sales as well
No problem though since the two classes that I did get into are great
Just patch me in
Hope to see you very soon
When we consider the serious electricity shortage in California our reaction as concerned Americans is Ha ha
No seriously we are alarmed
There it forms into lightning which is attracted to the earth by golfers
But you would be wrong
The question is What can the rest of us do to help our fellow countrypersons in California
The answer is that we can send them our spare electricity
So maybe we should go with Plan B
I didn't hear back from anyone but you
Few thought it would come to this
The difference would be used to pay their debts
Once again retailers were stymied in their search for ways to cut their customers' bills
But the birth of the exchange caused the death of his deal Wayne said
They said 'Why should we give you a discount when we can sell it to the Power Exchange ourselves
In dissenting Commissioner Richard A Bilas called the decision's paltry award to retailers another strike against them
Retailers Found Little Opportunity Be they multinational giants or kitchen-table entrepreneurs retailers are dismayed by their experiences with deregulation
Lay the Enron executive recalled that the utilities fought hard to maintain their customer base
Yeah but my name's not in it
I haven't heard that but I was running around quite a bit yesterday
Can you shed some light on this
When do we sign up
Until that happens we maintain that we require a cash prepayment or letter of credit to support any deal
I expect to hear from them again later today
Can you guys bring Annie
And on behalf of freedom-loving people everywhere thank you jean
It looks like progress is being made but the details will make it or break it
Is it a Survivor gig
Will report back soon as we get more info
As simple as this may sound it is in fact extremely challenging
It too has invented an amplifier that can handle eight separate strands except that its shares diodes between them
Hey gang I think that we should do the case
If you've gotten them from Vicky and Tom then we're set
Please keep me posted
Holy moly and hee haw how the heck are ya and what are you up to
I was out of town over the weekend and while I thought I'd have network access I didn't
If you have any questions just give a holler
Great to see you guys and despite all the excitement it was alot of fun
Hope that you made it back safely
Can I order two cases of coastal zin
How much per magnum is it
Thanks again for your help advice and Cristina's phone #
We'll see where it goes from here
I called Cristina and NO answering machine
I didn't think that happened anymore
Any way of leaving her a message
As you may know I sit on the CSU Foundation Board of Governors accountable to Chancellor Reed
George If you get a minute could you call to de-brief on the meeting we had the Gruma
Hope that it was helpful
Just let me know the time of the call
I'll adjust my schedule as needed on Monday
Please advise any conflicts you have on Monday
Don't even worry about it
Good to see you guys this weekend despite all the excitement
Thank you - Kari certainly seems to be an ideal candidate
Once initial contact is made I can follow up with details
I can pay you then
Just looking for someone to finance the development of my land
That'd be enough for me
Thank you for making me laugh a lot
Should have it soon
IEP needs to decide what position if any it is going to take on these measures
Could you call me when you get a chance
Impression of Judge This was my first time observing Judge Lew
Let me know I am thinking of going home to get my car and driving tonight
If I do I can give you a ride
Bill Yes I can be available to do the call
Hi Laura I'll be forwarding you additional information per your phone call with Steve
Late Friday afternoon Ziad called me
Please feel free to contact me with your questions
However who among you will be willing and able to post bids to sell
How do you want to handle
I will forward amendments as soon as they become available
Thanks but for some reason they didn't come across
Hi sorry to bother you but could you please print this out for me
See you in a few hours
Ironically the recently passed legislation takes choices away from consumers and diminishes their ability to manage their energy costs
So sorry I missed you
Deal your meal from where the dishes are located
Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation
This is much more important so I suggest using that money
Finally we can get Jeff's friend Karen to help us with the tiles
We will talk to her
Do you want me to page you with this call-in info
Sure enjoyed our time with you
Sorry but could you please print these out for me
Hi Vicki I'll try to track it down
Jeff can we figure out who filed the other complaint
Per your request please see the attached
Michael--do you have a copy of that SEC filing
The utility is required under state regulations to offer the credits it said
I am to be there tomorrow and Wed
Yes I'll put it on my calendar
Can you come to SF
Will you be back on Monday
Could pick it all up then if you want...Cameron's too
Besides most of the people who voted for it have already left the Legislature thanks to term limits
Why it did so remains something of a mystery
Buyers with no place else to go would pay ever-higher prices to get what they needed
The commission wanted to let them give it a try
The Assembly passed it the next day and Gov
Gray Davis signed it
That was true as far as it went
But we will never know
The Legislature acting in haste and with little information kept us from finding out
Thank you for you time with this matter
If not we'll certainly want to plug him in also
Will you let me know in the a.m.
As he said in the note we can wait on the tile
We'll contact our pal karen the tiling queen and report back
I don't always agree with PP's assessment
This guy sounds like he knows what he's talking about
We'll need to meld them
Gray Davis and his months of unfulfilled vows of a remedy
We have been very clear that we are frustrated with the timing and apparent lack of urgency
In fact they learned of it from press accounts
Apologies that it ain't proofed
Parquet ever get in touch with you
Please forward my apologies for missing the call
Hi you taking the afternoon off
Happy holiday to you too
Jim It was a pleasure speaking with you yesterday
I hope that the information is useful
These numbers are in line with our estimates
In California it takes about six years or longer
Hi Rosalee Steve asked that I forward this to you
Wondering where you were yesterday
Hope you didn't forget about the in-class quiz
Do most of you have Monday off
Thanks and please mark your calendars accordingly
Sandi McCubbin told me that I should consult with you
I would greatly appreciate it
I will also give you a call to follow up
We have offered to brief the Democrat Caucus but they have not expressed interest thus far
At this point however I have no confidence we will come to any resolution
We will be anticipating that siting is one of them
If you have knowledge of an= y of these projects and can assist with this research please call me
We'll need to discuss further internally but they may be correct in their assessment
I have a lot of time to work on it over the weekend though
And I assume that they are on the Izio site too
If I can't get the materials off of Izio I'll let you know
Mark I hope that if you're in Denver that means you're skiing
You up for it
I'll start messing with it and report back tomorrow
If others want to do the same have at it and we can compare notes
I thought the quiz was straight forward enough
Send me directions again to your house if you would
I'm not sure how we can get copies to you Jeff
If so any care to fax it to me
What's your expectations re Freeman paying us what he owes us
I told Chris that it looks fine with me
Jeff do you have the adress and fax number for the LA Office
Tracy Bob and Christian - do you approve
I intend to send this out Monday
I don't have the address
I can't recall
I can call and get the address if necessary
Ken Lay may have chaged it a bit
I took a stab at drafting the memo
I pooped out on the last question however and was only able to jot down some thoughts
Of course I will still help out if anyone needs any assistance
I thought that I was on the hook for this one
I'll be working on it tomorrow morning
I just got this
I agree that we should put it to bed soon
However we want to hold off on doing the stumps
I can' t thank you enough for organizing my business cards
I know it's a pain and I really appreciate it
Do you have the paper for that
Do I have any other expense thing-ees coming
I have attached the most recent versions of both bills
Linda I will have the California update done for Steve today
What time will he be leaving for LA
Given the situation it would still seem prudent to have Ken Lay talk to the Speaker
Deregulation has been a failure of epic proportions and Californians are hurting because of it
People have energy bills they cannot afford
Fairly sensitive item to put it mildly
Could you recommend how we can follow up with him
I am happy to direct him towards you
Chris Holmes recommended I contact you concerning the attached inquiry
Could you recommend the best avenue for responding to this request
I appreciate you assistance in this matter
Best to you and the family
I hope you and your family are doing well
I am sorry to have fallen out of touch
And thank you very much for paging him for me
Thanks very much for your help
Will try to turn it around pronto
That will help me keep track of the alphabet soup
Now he is the only veteran left surrounded by eager rookies
If you want to lob comments in tomorrow please call me first thing in the morning
Shmuel Flattered that you would ask
I should be able to participate
I'm still working on it but work cratered on me and I have to switch back to that now
I'll finish it up tomorrow and re-distribute
Herr Jackson I haven't had a chance to review your comments but I'll incorporate those in tomorrow as well
Need them by noon
In fact if you concur I'd like to send this around to the rest of the group right now
However I still am counting the days and looking forward to working with you folks
Thank you very much for the kind thoughts
I wish you the very best in your new responsibilities
A very very hearty congratulations on your promotion Ms Leibman
Thank you very much for including me on this
Really great to see you last week
If not please let me kn= ow
Instead she said that DWR will be responsible for those costs
Will report back just as soon as we get more information
Still she left no doubt that she believes the power problems could seriously crimp California's economic outlook
Found it shortly after I wrote the note
Problem is it won't work out that way
For weeks he has set deadlines for agreements and legislative action that haven't been met
They hear it and say 'OK sure
However he cautioned against missing deadlines
Would you want to re-elect Davis
The property has an abundance of water on it
Of course the possibility of evening fog raises some tricky issues and I haven't done soil tests
I look forward to talking further about the possibilities
I have included brief descriptions
I had a long conversation yesterday with Lt
Colonel Bill Wells who I promised to keep in the loop
I'll keep both of you updated
If I don't speak to you have a nice weekend
Yes that's my sister
Today we entered into an agreement with CDWR
This gives us the opportunity to work out the credit issues
If you have a minute can you give me a call
During the call they where working towards a Tuesday deadline
If you have any insight it would be greatly appreciated
However she said the improvements shouldn't deter consumers from conservation
SDG&E's rating is much better but its debt also was mounting
Dude got your message last nite--just missed it
We missed you at my birthday bash
I heard about the fire at the dome
I just got done ready your memo
I really liked what you have done
I did not want to make any direct changes but rather just pose a few questions for discussion
If you guys would like I can recalculate them
If we assume that the debt will be held in perpetuity we can directly compute the amount
Let me know and I can run the numbers
Also Jimmy when you do the color graphs you want to do
Gents Here it is
Dylan just go ahead and put your operating cash flow nos
Hope that all is well with you and yours
Yet the CEC used normal northwest hydropower production in its forecast
After that he says he will try to reduce demand
Concern It is somewhat disconcerting they have asked for and are considering this proposal
They also did not want to discuss their regulatory concerns and enter into a discussion with Dasovich regarding these
Just a consideration for our call Saturday
In the meantime they are proposing we price a short term deal
Please comment with concerns ideas immediately as we will be back on the phone with them shortly
OK here's what I propose
However my day's completely out of control and resolving now may be more than we can manage
This case is killing me
Whatever you guys want to do is fine with me
Finally what's the plan for your dad
When you moving to S.F.
What will you be focused on
In fact we have two problems a short-term problem and a long-term problem
But they are merely symptoms of a serious long-term crisis Incentives to the power industry are wrong
However the advantage of their flexibility must be balanced against their generally higher cost for meeting predictable long-term demand
Glen Weisbrod his son is president of Economic Development Research Group Inc in Boston
In addition he said the state must get more electrical power online by then
For residential users he said it will mean increases for use above a certain level
With him on the program were Sen John Kerry D-Mass. Sen Pete Domenici R-N.M. and Republican Gov
The administration should wait for a tax cut until the money is available he said
We get commensurate value in specific benefits which provide us long-term power at very cheap rates
Source Associated Press Other Developments ENERGY FORECAST California enjoyed its second straight day without a power alert
PS I meant to ask last night what the hell are we getting Eldon for his birthday
Jeanne while your at it could you get us a new Governor
However it may also hurt our claim that we should get a piece of the retained generation
Again let me know as soon as possible about your position
Glad to hear it went well
Whatever happened to Debra Stump do you know
Please accept my apologies for not having responded sooner
Things as you know are well a little nuts
I need to be in S.D
Perhaps we could have lunch or something and you could fill me in on what you folks do
What it does not do is implement a CPA mechanism
Alternatively we could work to get the other folks file individually
I think Bilas' approach makes sense
Let me know if you feel we should comment
What's your fax number
We should as you say push this along if we can
WASHINGTON--As he attempts to finalize a settlement with Southern California Edison Gov
They're just sticking to their guns
Just faxed it to you
Given time constraints might be more efficient if we agree internally prior to sending out to the coalition
Scott could you hold off until Mike gets and incorporates any internal comments
We told her that we need specific details
Here are some more details forwarded by our outside counsel
Beck in the construction planning and design of its systems
Greetings Jess I work in Government Affairs in San Francisco
Feel free to give me a ring
In addition they would like to be able to offer the customer some options for continuing gas service
Too little is being purchased as it should be -- days or even months in advance
Others depending on their needs would be squirreling away supply a month even a year in advance
How's it going with this stuff
What are we doing on the Friday of Eldon's b-day
Someone that I know forwarded it along to me
Know anything about it
If it makes sense for me to meet with them just let me know
Then we can decide if and how we choose to respond to the PUC staffer
I hope this sheds a little more light on this issue
Anyone know about it
As such at a minimum the PNW's electric bill will necessarily increase if California closes its doors
And again I also realize that economics may not have traditionally been a driver in the industry
This is the hard question that we need to answer
We may also outreach to our editorial board list as well
If we want to recommend additional provisions could you let me know what those are
Thanks very much for getting back to us
This was not our intention
Can you indentify the owner of this record
I mean will we be celebrating in some fashion
Nancy sorry this took a while but it will be worth it
Have you guys spoken in the last few months
When would you normally get back
This will replace the Internal resource form we were using previously
I tried to incorporate the material from the IRTF reports
This report is too backward looking in its current form
Given your relationship thought you might be able to check
However your presence would indeed make it more festive and birthday celebrationy
Jeff D I assume you know who Lad Lorenz is
What you say
Very interested in exploring the possibilities with you
Referred to you by Lee Green
Again can't thank you enough for responding
I don't know where it'll lead but I've got a hunch that it just might work out
In its financial reports Dynegy highlights the uncertainties with some contract valuations
In large part he says those estimates are based on quoted market prices where available
The average length of Enron's risk-management contracts is just two years he says
Mr Mott further explains that Dynegy could be realizing more cash earnings now if it wanted to
That seems to be what his initial proposal will be
Reliant has opposed anything other than full payment of its debts
Can you verify
Do you folks agree it could not happen quicker
Laura Thanks so much for including me on the list
Yes I would like to attend if that would be possible
Do you think you may attend
This they cannot do
On top of this daily/weekly cycle there is the seasonal shift in load diversity you noted
For the Northwest its peak load occurs when energy production is the lowest -- during the winter
The Northwest may be capacity long but it is typically energy short even in flush hydro years
I hope this rambling response comes at the question you raise
Bill In order to assess I need to understand the structure
As usual I will get breaking information to you when it happens
Hope I can get out of here today
Looking forward to any participation that you folks can offer
I can be flexible
Here's a catalogue of issues that Sue Mona and I put together using Paul's outline as a guide
I asked him to keep me updated
He said that he would
If it's appropriate I would like to attend
Thank you very much for the tech data
Inadvertently didn't include you on first distribution
IEP testifie= d in support of the bill noting we were still working with the author on language
In return DWR offered to post information about their power contracts and terms AFTER contracts were executed
But might be useful to discuss tomorrow when you return
Seems useful to try to get a start on it tomorrow
In that regard Mike Smith is going to try to craft some language and forward it to you
All in all I think everyone's on the right track
Likewise many of our companies signed or are negotiating long-term contracts with the California Department of Water Resources
Any chance we can get a spot of your time
Call at your convenience
Just let me know when you'd like to chat
The FTC info that you need is set forth below
Please call us with any questions you may have
Appears that all went well even though our communications remain a wee bit bumpy
Glad to hear that it all worked out
Difficult to keep it al straight these days
Please call me if you are unable to participate
If there's anything I can do don't hesitate
If you have any questions about it or want to discuss it further just let me know
As we discussed it's creating a good deal of consternation in the market
Finally we'd be very interested meeting with you and the folks from McKinsey on our reverse-auction for demand reductions
Williams did so for what it has called a reasonable profit
What the FERC will do is save the ISO from itself
If you need anything else just let me know
Neither of us will say one critical thing of the other
I won't say anything in jest or otherwise and you do the same
And if someone does the other needs to bring it up
I hope you'll going sailing today
Did I leave my sunglasses in your car
I also left my gym bag in your bathroom which has my sailing shoes in it
You can call me here
I just don't want to be criticized anymore
But when you do it every time after a while it just starts to hurt my feelings
You're often telling everybody how neurotic and fucked up I am
In fact you just said that today to my friends at Haas
Do you know how embarassing that was for me
I've tried to talk to you about it
I asked you to spend some time trying to say mostly nice things just for a little while
I'm sure there are things you want me to do
I'd like to try to do them
It makes me feel like shit
I don't know where else to go Jeff
I suggested talking to a shrink but you're not willing to do that either
I sent it before you sent your note I think
You will have a very difficult time touching base with her
I'm not getting it
Please continue sending if you can
But they may be wrong
Yes I will be joining folks for dinner
Please contact me if you have any further questions
Haven't had a chance to read what you wrote
Attaching what I cobbled together yesterday
You should feel free to go ahead and meld mine and yours etc
And thanks a million for pulling it together
We'll disseminate information just as soon as we get it
The model that we used was an annual rate model
The analysis that you are proposing would require a monthly model which would take additional time to develop
The Best Case reflects the date included in your original >analysis
I've assigned my view of what the probabilities are
Therefore we request that you Compare the methodology used by FERC with that of Professor Joskow
Thank you for investigating this matter
Tell me it ain't so Bob
If you would like to chat further let me know
Is he hostile to Direct Access
I fear I already know the answer
Do you have any time to call in
Jeff Wood is our Commissioner on the Negative CTC Complaint
See you all in Houston
Sure would have been nice if the commission had passed it though
If so when is it effective
I'll anxiously await your return
Swan's it is
Looking forward to seeing you at the Woodlands
If you don't bid your bid cap is applied
Do you have the call-in number for the ISO call today
His wager is still on the table but the assumptions that underlie it are looking increasingly shaky these days
That in turn raises the prospect that California's economy and its credit rating both could deteriorate significantly
If not it will be forced to keep buying huge amounts of costly power in the cash market
Yes agree that another call to weave in the comments we received from the biz units would be useful
Can we shoot for Wednesday when Mr Kaufman will be here in the SF office
I think this requires some scrutiny/scrubbing
I will pursue conflict in EES
Jeff - think we need another conference call soon
Let me know how this looks
Could you provide a brief update
Please review the document an send me any comments
As always please let me know if you have any questions
As always call if you have any questions
IEP testified in support of the bill still noting we were still working with the author on language
Did you get the document I sent yesterday morning
I'll be able to do the call but we need to keep it brief
I have asked him to confirm the time
Hope it works at your end
Contact your UDC
Could you check on this
It should not apply to me
If it is in the mail please disregard this message
Many thanks for your cooperation
They also say that at great expense they delayed much-needed maintenance in order to keep the power flowing
The report however was heavily qualified by the FERC which said it did not investigate other forms of manipulation
He said he'd do the road but can't do it with the wood that's in the driveway
Hope you had a good time in Mexico
The state is signing long-term contracts for its share of power which reduces demands on ratepayers
So far the utilities are not asking for their past debts to be repaid
When the Legislature put the state in the power-buying business it needed to ensure eventual reimbursement for its purchases
Meanwhile Davis is faced with a dilemma of his own that is no less wrenching
I'll keep you posted on developments as they transpire
If you have any questions don't hesitate
I have forwarded the info to Ken and just spoke with him
Dylan Don't kill me
We can talk about it tonight
Please refer all media inquiries to me
If there's anything just let me know
How does Socal Gas adjust for its cost of gas
I need an update as soon as possible
Someone sent me some press on the hearing that looked great
Sounds like Tues and Wed it is
However we need to be consistent in our participation or be satisfied with inconsistent coverage
Just realize that I try to cover the same calls
If you'd like to drill down deeper into any particular issue listed below just let me know
The central points that I believe I would make include the following among others
This is incorrect and I think that this needs to be explained clearly
Any reports of it in Washington D.C
Can you guess which organization this is
It was not mentioned to me
The utilities are installing their own meters at the schools
I see that AReM is participating as well
How goes it
The governors asked for prompt action on their request
Could you please send these to Blackout Busters
Prior to the UC/CSU blow-up I would have said yes
Now my inclination is to lay low
So Edelman would ask interested reporters to call us to discuss AReM issues
Apologies if I had your phone number I'd have called you
If you give me your number I can call you
This guy's been after me for some time
Thank you very much for your consideration
Were you referring to that or something more general
I would be curious however to know if you did or not
Sounds like I'm glad that I missed the quiz last week
Hate to be a nag but we've got to turn in what we're doing for our project on Thursday
Obviously if you think we have misrepresented something please let me know so that we can correct it
I believe we have most of the exhibits
Call me when you have had a chance to review
Accordingly we would like to have this finalized and signed tonight if possible
Is it close to the ski resorts
Please advise ASAP your availability Thursday
If I have left anyone off this list that you feel should participate please forward this e-mail
Chris Did you find out who the folks are from Navigant working on the contracts
It's been an incredible pleasure working with you
Hope your weekend was nice
Tried to call but I think your voicemail is messed up out there today
Checking in to see whether Hoecker said it or not
That was our deadline correct

I think it makes more sense there
Questions for you Is Zircom in an easily definable industry so we can make comparable studies and valuations
Is their much public history of the firm
I for one have little knowledge or confidence in myself of analyzing a tech company
Remember we have to make guestimates about the future of the industry and predict sales costs etc
I was just brainstorming on potential projects
Wholesalers have cut off their credit leading the state to buy power for them
In Washington FERC said it would overhaul its regulation of the Western energy market to increase supply
Davis opposes releasing it

Also I was on a call with Eric yesterday during which I went over the S.D
I'll get on just as soon as I can
I will be distributing the proposal immediately and attempting to garner support industry-wide across the nation
Don't hesitate to contact me to discuss it further
Lamentably they don't have a plan
Please let us know how it goes
Catherine or Jim Foster can you help out
But they seem to have other ways of being influential
Bill/Scott is this guy familiar to you
I'll ask him about participating in the Coalition
I'll let you work that end
If this passes we should be in pretty good shape
Will keep you apprised
I'll likely be getting back to you
Not wanting to keep you waiting for a reply I thought it best to give you some feedback immediately
We cannot competitively price this type of customer versus the utility and extract enough margin to support them
Should you have additional questions please reply or call
Greetings Sorry to bother you with this but please see notes below
I'm assuming that you might know whom that would be
If you need anything just holler
I'll make sure to copy you Sue and Joseph so we all stay on the same page
Again we can add to and subtract from the list
Let me know if you think the effort would be worthwhile
Appreciate your comments
I'm sure the CPUC will take notice in their proceedings
The administration's top priority is to prevent blackouts he said
In fact in our view they will seriously aggravate the supply crisis
I must tell you that
Why did it go bust
Should it have gone through
If you have any concerns with this proposal please let us know
Figured you had it in hand
I think we still have a role for him but it will be far more limited
Steffes filled me in
If there's anything you need don't hesitate
On behalf of free-market loving people around the world thank you

Congratulations to you both
I know how these cat-herding exercises can be
But for the very minor edits attached the letter looks fine with me
We're a client so I'm assuming internally we have access codes for folks to use
Could you please book me a ticket for Portland
If you'd like to de-brief on my marathon with Kasler just give a holler

May want to send it out yet this evening
I don't have her email address though
Can you send it to her
I think I'll need to protest TURN's proposal
Let me know if you want to see the TURN comments

Action Hedy is aware of the situation and has asked Staff to tell her of any more occurrences
Hedy has my number and will be in touch with any reports at which time we will take action
Jeff and Eric I have NO problem trying to get letters for support of Direct Access
Eric if we can get those to support Jeff and Sandi this is wonderful

Thanks very much to you both
It is better if you do it yourself
Let me know if it does not go thru
Please see Jeff's e-mail sent to you last Friday
If not the I don't think BOMA will support the bill any more
I'm sure the CPUC will take notice in their proceedings.

CalEnergy has a court hearing tomorrow on its Edison contract
Mike Here are my comments
Apologies for the fact that they are quick and dirty
And if it hasn't it could represent a significant conflict with previous statements
Regarding the statements about our hedging strategy
Would therefore not seem accurate to call them imprudent now
Please see my comments on Dennis' declaration got some serious concerns
That TOTALLY works for me
I think that it's a good idea
However from my perspective though it's a significant concern it's one that can be addressed
Have you checked the web site for the questions
Could you let me know if you receive this
Something that we can talk about in Mexico

Hi Laura Is it possible to get a copy of the report
Of course the highlight of the semester for me was seeing Ms Deepika at Squaw last weekend
I'll just have to save my celebrations up I guess
Due to logistical complications I've had to go to a Dial-In number for our call with you tomorrow
Let me know that you got this information
Although something could get out of the Senate it won't go anywhere without Administration support
If we feel that can be overcome then the next big deal will be getting transportation agreements with SoCalGas

That answers it

From the start of the energy crisis the state has planned to repay its power purchases through bond sales
And it could mean political trouble for Davis
I was holding back a bit
All I needed was the green light
I'll make it explicit
I am very ready to start getting the word out
If you're going to use it let's pay for it
I sure didn't like the blackouts
Yet if rates are not high enough they may not prevent daily blackout threats this summer and beyond
I'm out next week but will probably give you a call to discuss a bit
Enron had its own reasons to hook up with CalPERS
But as a public company it has to worry about showing quick returns Fastow said
As it turns out CalPERS patience has not been tried
The more they like it on the natural the more expensive it will be to defeat the measure
But I will be on the call tomorrow
Given the circumstances it's a win-win and still leaves us with the swaption to exercise at a later date
When I call you're always in a meeting
I will be on the leadership call tomorrow
Thanks all for your help for now
Thanks for your immediate attention

Previously he was the president and founder of Compare.Net the leading buyer's guide on the Internet
And I'd be happy to call him and harass him

So I think Peevey is a key influential
Also what was the name of the association you forwarded the package to
I'll check and get back to you
Please give me the low-down

I'm traveling today but wanted to let you know that those are the balance of my comments
I love sports
But y'all should go ahead without me
A week's vacation was all she needed
Some firms are contesting the findings saying the prices they charged were justified
I need to check more but here's my take
Would that push them into bankruptcy
You still have your PCG position
Will it be introduced today
When might it be voted on
I can't do Burton's district
Don't feel like it
And it wasn't my idea
So forget it
Thought that you might find this interesting
Gradually the company expanded its use and scope
Last month the company re-launched Enron Credit in its current format

Should I just phone Mike Day
But a lawyer I am not
Are our contracts silent on the issue
We'll make up the difference for you and Eldon
PG&E's decision today does not change our position
If others don't have it and want it let me know and I'll fax it

Despite the jobs cuts at Enron Broadband she said the unit is recruiting to fill some other positions
We're keeping them
Hope you won't miss them
We're keeping our dairy products
We Californians are gonna keep all our high-tech software in state
Silicon Valley is ours after all
Without enough electricity which you're apparently keeping for yourselves we just plain don't have enough software to spare
We're keeping all our airplanes
Maybe you could get back in the habit of writing letters
We make them here
Since we'll now have to make them with our own electricity we're keeping them
You can no longer have any of our wine
You all complain that we don't build enough power plants
This is your last warning America

The more complicated the case lawyers say the more energized he becomes
He also loves to sail walk his dog and spend time with his granddaughter
Many institutional investors won't own stock in a bankrupt company and analysts stop following it
They're making decisions we have no control over
For the very same reasons others say it will bog down
But that doesn't mean it can't go lower
But it continues to underperform badly over the long term
Instead he says it could take two to three years
If anything she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even worse than it is
Do we know who got to Breathitt

What's more they can't buy less power than their customers need
I had a blast skiing--been way to long
I haven't called Ashish
I'll pick someone off of your list to call
Wasn't it a gorgeous weekend
Since I had to make a similar decision Meg thought I should talk to him

If not go ahead and we can trade someone from my list and I will call Ashish
Just let me know who you pick on my list
Attached you will find the call assignments for the new admits
They see the Edison deal as extremely adverse to their interests

Can we get pictures

Hi Could you send me a copy of the Trustee letter
Sorry about S.D. but it will be super nice down there

I would be very concerned though given the current environment about having us listed as a sponsor
In short I would recommend against sponsoring at least at this point
Rob Lapsley Bill's Undersecretary just called an told me the good news
Here is what I am thinking
Which of you members would like to be sponsors
And yes I did get a haircut
I don't know about the roommate info but I do know that they go back a very long way
I suspect most will use the wire stories
As we discussed here is the statement we used today

That time works for me
Michael and I are both in SF on Monday evening

Appreciate you sharing this
I'll be getting you stuff tonite or tomorrow
I don't answer the bottom line question since we have some talking to do on the model
All my stuff is highlighted in yellow
Take a look and let me know what you think
Guess I was lazier still
Unless other folks have comments on the model I think you're good to go for the memo
Am ready to look at it when you've got a draft
I was getting a little lazy
I agree about your working capital assumption
I guess I'm not clear on your conclusion
I guess I vote we double the price
Should you have any problems opening the attached documents please let me know
Perhaps you could help me with something
Based on a previous e-mail could you please give me an idea as to who I can eliminate
When the proposal nets out the deferral costs does it include the over/undercollections associated with utility residual generation
I'll continue to check it and de-bug it
Mark you and I should talk too
If anyone has any questions on the model just let me know
And perhaps we should think about meeting this weekend
I have no comments
So I won't be able to be in class tonite
Also I think there'll be a case of Overture
If that doesn't entice you I don't know what will
I would really love it if you guys could be there
After all summer is on the way and we want to be able to impress our teachers and mentors

I hope not anyway
Just give us the total for Squaw and we'll cut you a check
A copy of his proposal is attached
Also I hope to have additional input from Barbara Barkovich before Monday's meeting
Our schedules make it messy
Mark if you want to hunker down with the model tomorrow you should feel free
Can we talk about meeting this weekend
Come prepared so we can be efficient
I can meet Tuesday evening Sat PM or Sunday
I can meet tonight during break on Tuesday and basically anytime on Saturday or Sunday
Having worked with you on the Perfect project I now know that your power point skills are legendary

Jeff can we meet at your office
Mark if you want to hunker down with the model tomorrow you sh

I can give you some more ideas if you like
I think it all sounds great
I can make the dressing on Thursday night
Jeff can you help me with this pasta

Is it possible to participate by conference call or would you prefer that folks attend in person
I plan on attending the hearing
Greetings I tried to log in and the system told me that I'm not authorized to use the system
We can go over it then
It actually adds up as far as I can tell
It was fun as hell but it sure weren't cheap
She sees this part of her that isn't fair or compassionate and really wants to change it
As for the bill don't you think that's high
How much was your half
Did they provide you with a break-down of the charges
I don't mean to be a pain but I don't really trust their methods after this debacle
I'll give it a go
Let us know your thoughts
What time do you get home from school
Cameron said that she and Scott want tickets too
With that news all of our team meetings and conference calls have been cancelled
I will defer to your schedules
Please tell me what day and hour looks best for you
OR Is there an existing call that we could join
I just don't want to lose focus
That was very generous of you
I got both checks last night so thank you
Here's the document that I referenced
Dan Allegretti asked me to forward it to you
As always thanks very much for your help
Greetings I intend to clear my calendar to help with this for the rest of the week
I'll call you/you call me first thing in the AM
I thought you said no
So I let it go
I think that chances are extremely slim though
Though it feels like it at times he's not my Dad
You know how to get a hold of me
Good to see you yesterday
Please forward to others whom you think might be interested
Stephanie could you forward along to Barry
Can I catch up with you after
I made it almost all the way through the document
If I can get Steve's assignment finished quickly I will turn my attention back to this
Hope it helps
There is a protective order in place in the proceeding so I don't believe the information is generally available
Was it broken down by shipper
Also did you request confidential treatment
Is this what you called to discuss
Make sense for me to attend the meeting
Greetings Look forward to it
Are you available tomorow to discuss further
I recently joined Enron Global Markets on the LNG team
That's where I need your help
This is not proofed but I wanted to make sure that everyone had a chance to review and comment
I think that it would be perfect
PG&E's got it right
I have forwarded both the referenced advice letters to you earlier
Don't hesitate to call if there's anything you need
Maybe we can talk Jessie into having a drink
It seems they were really requested
It is suggestible before starting the operation to keep them under warm water for a couple of minutes
Then you shape it as a brick or tube as you like
All that aside I have obviously missed the times it's my fault and I apologize
I'll read it then call you
Like your arguments Scott
Hope work is fun and your classes are good
And you slacked on the happy hour
Best Jeff Per your request attached are the presentation slides from yesterday
The pleasure Ms Denne is all mine
If the provision remained in the bill IEP would continue to push the Republicans to hold their opposed position
Thanks a million for your help--we really needed it--and you managed to leave with your credibility intact to boot
I can cover the hearings on Monday and Tuesday
My schedule melted down after we talked on Monday
If it gets real ugly trying to find a smaller group let me know
Yes we have been working with them
Stephanie left them with Reliant's Westwide demand exchange program
I'll let others chime in but seems to me that it would be very useful to contact him
Are we in communication or working with Reliant in California
Could you please send around the model too
I want to use for the financials table
The answer to me clearly is no
Making money off a crisis is not necessarily illegal he said
Market conditions can place private companies in the catbird's seat allowing them to reap big bucks
Are they obligated -- legally not morally -- to restrict their profits
Give me a call if this does not make sense
I mean on the approach for dealing with Edison re alternative structures for payment
You looking at it
She has worked hard on this and I think wants to be involved and participatory
I was sensing that she was frustrated
Please so advise me your availability -- or preferable time if need be
Therefore we cannot protest the PE advice letter on that basis
I do not expect us to succeed in obtaining that subsidy
See you tonight
Never hurts to inquire and I appreciate the consideration
I would rather you not
At some point though it gets tough beating one's head against the wall
We've made a lot of sacrifices to do it and the point is to learn
But thanks very much for all the work you did
It was important and the presentation is better off for it
My house keys are in it so it would great to get it back
Second could you do me a favor
Do you have a copy of the order
It's not an emergency bill so it will be dealt with throughout the remainder of the spring and summer
I'll be going to everything whether it makes sense or not and spending a lot of money
Tell them sorry for leaving all my stuff lying around
Drinking red wine like that really fucks me up big time
Unfortunately there wasn't much of it there
I had a great time though
I hope you had an okay time
I actually thought afterwards that that might be easier for you
Could you just tell me the amount again and I'll put it in the mail today
Let me know if this is what you're looking for
While I too am frustrated at how things turned out I'm glad your content overall with the course
However you are very kind to consider my perspective on the group and project
It would have saved all of us time
I'm counting on Mark to drive this home for us smoothly
I have never been embarrassed to be with you
I don't want to end anything but we need to fix it or we'll have have to end it
I love you and miss you
It's also not how I feel
I don't feel animosity
I'd rather do it with you than alone
If you want to end this relationship I can't stop you
By the way if you get a chance please say hello to Michael Zenker
We reserved our right to oppose it in the stip
Did you hear from Sue Mara re how the California ISO works
Give a call and we can discuss further
Greetings Could you email me the final version of the stipulation
Was that ever filed and if so can you please send a copy
I think that would be it
Wednesday morning works for me
Reply Separator Early Wed works for me
I do not have everything yet
You want to call me at my office
I cleaned this up a little bit
Apologies it's quick and dirty but it provides the basics
Should we see if she wants to go
Harry Per my voicemail
Yes I can do the call
Please let me know if these positions make sense to you
Once we start to hone in on the concept we can develop the right numbers
He understands our problems with the bill but suggested we may want to recommend a solution
Individual companies may want to give him the specifics
Where are we with our meetings with members of the committee
IEP met with Kip in Sher's office who was noncommittal but agreed with our arguments against the bill
Or maybe we can do that over lunch
Thank you for helping on this
Hope that it helped
What was the gist of his comments regarding the gas side
If Ken Lay's going to be in Sac seems that he should meet with John Burton
Are both of you
Mary agree that we don't need to file separately
If Ken Lay's going to Sac to have meetings seems that he should meet w/Burton
If you do not have the numbers let me know and I will get them for you
Might be shorter but I can't imagine that it would go any longer
I think this captures it
See my note and Christine's response
He suggested I pick a group rather than him just randomly choosing one to assign me to
You seemed nice based on my initial reaction to meeting you which is why I approached you about it
I greatly appreciate your help
Might be useful to run it by Richard Sanders

No big deal but I want to make sure things don't get more complicated than they need to be
I sent to you yesterday the solutions piece
I have cleared my calendar so any time in the morning works for me
At this time however we do not have any alternative language for the bill
Please call if you need copies of any of the bills
Rob had Robert Michaels give me a ring re potential panelist at the field hearing
Be happy to pitch him to Ms Van Way
I think rather than Crawford you might be referring to David Cox Republican leader of the California Assembly
Really can't thank you enough for you help on this
I have calls into all the offices
We left it that the others will call me back
Here's my game plan
Let me know if this works for folks

Anybody would be confused with what we've thrown at you
Can't thank you enough for you help
Hope you had a nice weekend
If so could you forward to me
A little colder weather And we all freeze together Wishin' more plants were on the line
All the things I'm missin' Like lights and television Are waiting 'til we can pay the price
You'll have my backgrounder tomorrow
If there's anything else don't hesitate to contact me
I am not so sure
I think that we should just call a spade a spade
Hi Anita Thanks again for you help with the questions I had about the deals going on California
I'd like to discuss with you two as soon as possible

Thank you Rosalee
Karen can you forward along to Marathon
I apologize but I can't make this call though I'm confident that you folks can handle it

I'd appreciate it if you would coordinate details with Jeff
Thanks a million for your help

I thought they would both be in Sacramento w/ Steve
Am faxing you the presentation right now
Dude If I don't see you good luck this weekend have fun and congratulations

I hope so

Let me know before I cancel the tee time
Glad to hear Sue picked it up

Help charactarize when we officially made request so that we provide an accurate perception of the three utility's responses
Jeff we are rolling out a CEC/CALISO curtailment initiative in California that provides major benefits to our customers
However primitive that opinion is we are stuck with it
Lemme know if that works for you guys
Thursday night is the dinner at our house with Colleen
Can we have a call tomorrow to discuss status etc.
Ian said he would make that work
We'll do it in the city
Should we try something new
Yes they will have to file with the PUC
Are you interested in going
I thought not
As I mentioned this situation is extremely fluid
Hoping that you can get that for us
Thanks a bunch for your help with this
This works for my schedule
I will likely attend the subpoena meeting
Finally I have asked everyone to schedule a day and a half for this meeting
Although we may be finished on Tuesday I thought it was prudent to leave Wednesday open for further discussion
Can you call when you get a chance to regroup
Let me know if this tracks with where we're headed
I think you 've got the call-in number
To participate you must arrive early and sign-in to speak
Thank you for your help at this critical time
WHAT are you doing working so late
If you need help converting into quarterly numbers let me know
I intended and will be sure to include Karen on the stuff that I pull together today
Please use karen as your point person
I'd say it further adds to our momentum
Haven't seen him since
Lynch or her senior staff
I don't have an attachment
I apologize profusely
But having read this you obviously needed no help from me
Let me know how the call with Riordan goes
Hi Maureen Could you please make sure that Steve gets these
Michael did we decide to use the PUC's load numbers
Yes please submit my name
Do you want me to submit your name for participation
I am swamped
You know the pace at school is so much nicer--actually have time to think about things and absorb it
Are you driving to Sacramento every day
Say it ain't so
When you say full time you mean school full time
That I assume means leaving your job
Be happy to talk about it
If full time makes sense you ought to do it
Or I could meet you during break on Monday
I was worried about you--seemed liked you'd gone underground again
Remember life's too short to get too worried about it
Let me know what works for you
I LOVE the company the learning the work the teams the people the career opportunities
Are you available at break on Tuesday for a beer
I think you've spoken with Karen Denne
Next thing you know we'll want to buy the nukes
Hell it might be fun
Please please keep Dave out of it
If so please forward to me
We need to respond to him
They just did it because they could
There isn't even unanimity for this position on his staff
Think we need to schedule some educational meetings
Hope all's well on your end
Mark we'll call you
Glen I'll call you also
Kim Steve if you guys want to sit-in we'll make the call from one of the offices
Monday I am traveling
Unfortunately I wasn't thoughtful enough to send flowers but a large bouquet is certainly in order
She thinks it came from one of us but I think it must have come from her boyfriend
Were any of us being very thoughtful on Friday
Just wanted to make sure that you folks received the materials
I pulled this together very hastily on Friday and take responsibility for all errors omissions ramblings etc
And if she's unable to find one then we can talk
Hi Twanda I can make the call
Jeff Soo and I are available for the conference call
Simon did a nice job on the presentation but I need some things re-arranged added etc
Should I call him directly other

Alas-I'll tell you all about it when we talk
I sent Diane an email to get the deadlines etc
FYI I am out of town so I am not available by phone until Monday
Sorry I was unable to make the call yesterday
Did we set a time for the next call on Friday
I'll get you one more name then
Talk to you in an hour
That decision has not been issued yet but it may happen today
Similar information was not available for SCE and San Diego but suggest it could be used as a proxy
I am on back to back conference calls
Looks complete to me
If I am unavailable Jim Steffes should be contacted
Jeff Dasovich will manage all work associated with the Global Settlement whether it is legislative or not
This particular issue is a critical matter for our company
Never hesitate to get in touch if you need anything
Look forward to working with you folks
As always can't thank you enough
You probably know that and more but I'm passing it on
You going to brief me tonite on tomorrow's meeting
Thanks so much for it all
Almost makes any more engagements superfluous don't you think
And she said...YES
We will really miss you guys
It they are not ready by Friday the suppliers will meet separately to discuss next steps
We will fax it to you
I will probably do RMW
Sorry I had to get off the call early
Hope it helped
If there's anything else you need just let me know
What's your vote
Thank you for the feedback
When that's done I assume it will OK to distribute
If you're still looking for comments I have one suggestion
If you could somehow highlight that section--make it stand out more
Lastly I love the chart on growth
I'm trying to meet a deadline at the moment but are you free this afternoon
Would you know how to get something like that
I'll give you a call then
If Cameron has to work are you available
I'll do it babe
I agree that tidying up is in order
Yes forwarded the email you sent last week
First we think that the folks in your first group are mean
Have you had a chance to convey what I said to the group and can I join
As you know I want to make sure I am in one to do the next assignment with
Look forward to seeing you when you in California
Apologies but I'm trying to make sure that I have the meeting times right
Do I have these right
See you at Sun bright and early
At this point I'm planning on accompanying you to LA but we can play by ear
That clears it up
Would have much preferred to have spent it with you guys
You guys outdid yourself
If you have any questions just holler
You know I don't mind eating really late
I'm glad you liked it
Here are my edits
I have to go to Portland tomorrow coming back Wednesday afternoon
I will participate in the call
Can you join
Ken thought the meetings were very worthwhile though he was pooped by the time he got to the airport
Ken had wanted us to send this out today
If not we need to send it out Monday unless Steve has objections
No big deal but I thought I'd flag it for your consideration
Please let me know if you will be able to join
If I missed anyone please forward along
Thanks so much for all you did for Prentice
I think she had a really really good time and felt really neat about the whole thing
OK so I am doing everything that I can to leave for the Dome Wednesday night
Then coming back you can drive the Suburban and I can drive the SAAB
Finally Eldon do you have the Blue Book at your house
Yes my trunk can handle that easily
I'm going to inform folks that I will be off Thursday/Friday
I'll let you what reaction I get
You know that I love you very much Prentice
In fact it may even dissuade electricity investment
In recent years Californians have consistently ranked education as their top issue
I'm very interested in buying Jay's property but I don't even the details yet
Here's my suggestion
If they want to come up that bad they should
To be honest we didn't expect it to be this quick but hey it is what it is
Where can I call you
I just talked to my mom and they are chomping at the bit if that's the right expression
I told her to chill a bit that she might not be able to see Jay's property
They are damn excited and I don't really know how to calm them down
They are probably talking about it all the time
She also asked me if you were thinking of buying it and I told her I wasn't sure
I know they'd totally respect your position if we told them that
Anyway give me some advise on this matter please
Hope to get to see you in person again soon
Thanks for noticing and letting me know
Why don't you send this also to Phillip Allen
Apologies for the oversight of not including you on the list
If you have any questions etc
This is the system we set up
Unequivocally we have never held anything back
I guess Lee's e-mail changes things
Jeff has said he likes the idea of coordinating
Bill and Allen what do you think
I should note that ICF will not be able to contribute
I heard from Michael Berg this morning
So he will not be participating in our discussions either
I got his response today that it was
I would simply prefer to join one that I chose
I appreciate you're group's helping me out of this awkward spot if they decide to let me in
If folks would like them let me know
I will report back after we've spoken
However for cash flow purposes it should be considered
I hope this helps in your analysis and please feel free to call and discuss further
I'm stuck and need your help
Can you clean up the letter
Can you send me the info from their cards
Note Please discard the file that I sent you yesterday and replace it with this one
As you know it's crazy in California with a lot flying around in numerous forums
Have messages in to him
Can you try and call Seabron today to discuss
See if his understanding helps with California issues

Let me know if you want a briefing or futher info
All the best to all three of you
I'll send you the latest
I'll include you from this point on in the distribution list
Again this is not at all about making your life more difficult just a case of being well-informed

Was it an emergency bill
If additional copies are needed please contact me or Scott Govenar
Good talking to you last nite
The Speaker has it
Give a call if you have any questions
Rick Morrow was very unhappy with it which in some ways surprised me
Man you were loaded for bear
The points you made came off very compelling
Can we get it from you
Hope it is useful to you
Rosalee Could you please print out the following two documents for Mr Lay
If you have any questions just let me know
Maureen can you print out for Steve too
Let me know if you're still having problems
Also I reorganized the format extensively for what I thought was a better flow
I didn't mark the changes because it got too confusing
You can incorporate Christi's revisions with mine
I was just about through when I got her message so I didn't try to start over
As discussed I hope to get input from the gas fundamentals group tomorrow and finalize this document by Friday
I welcome your feedback
We will advise everyone of what we learn
Michael how can we get with PG&E to determine where the discrepancy lies
First the prices they are getting won't be great for customers
Seems to have Riordan written all over it
I'll have Joseph email it to you
I'd blow it off
Well if you're going to want someone from Enron it's going to have to be me
Let me know if you're still interested
Are independent unregulated generators concerned about our natural gas future
Greetings Have you seen this
Yeah tell me about it
So that means you DON'T enjoy my loving ribbing
I hope I'm not confusing matters more
My face is fine thank you
The session was tightly choreographed and neither side expected a resolution of their differences
Davis his approval rating plummeting is searching for a scapegoat d and a way out of the energy crunch
Mindful of the national stage he commanded Davis planned a news conference to air his grievances
Could you also forward to the SF office
Finally I have a call into Hertzberg to see what else I can learn
I'll keep trying and keep you informed
Thank you ever so much for sharing
Do we know what station
I can make out however that it is the core/noncore plan
Please keep confidential that we have a copy
Please let me know what works best for you
I ask for your continuing patience
It sounds to me like just pure politics
They don't want voters to pay because they vote
To date they have shown a firm inclination to go their own way
I have been working on purchase versus pooling all day
I'm about to lose my mind
If so do you guys wan't to play golf on Sunday morning
Thanks for bringing the wine my shirt loved it
If so I hope you can join us in a nummy little repast
If not I will put a check in the mail when you let me know the amount
Unlike some I always carry my checkbook with me
Those were incredibly beautiful knives that you guys gave Cameron
You can wait till we see you to pay
So you are not taking Annie with you
They were in her purse and she can't find them now
Did they not charge the corkage
Anthony said he is working alone on these proposals
Here's the document that I sent and the list of folks that I sent it to
Here's the document that I received from the lobbyist today
It's the same document that I distributed internally yesterday
Best Jeff I attended the Chamber meeting today and the discussion focused on P.R
Karen Do you have a copy of the Dow Jones article
I'd like to email the piece to Brulte if you don' t have any objections
Ken is on vacation but I will send this to him
Did we talk to Leopold
It was too early to say whether the governor would support the plan he said
We're dangerously close to losing our businesses to other states
Let me know how it goes
I think you're dead on
I'll check w/ Mark but I doubt he would know what we gave to Hertzberg and the chamber
Should I talk to Jason on background and set him straight
Davis' threat came out of the blue they said
Freeman finds himself in a somewhat awkward position on the matter
For his part Freeman insisted that no such pricing had occurred on his watch
They will get back to me when they find out
I'll report back soon as I hear something
You want to take it
I know Cameron had a great time
Do you want me to help you collect funds for dinner
I hope today is not too painful
She's up for golf so expect us Saturday night
If so I think Tim should talk
If not who and what are you talking about

I recommend that you wait

I have a contact

Hope you guys had a wonderful weekend at the dome.
Is there ANYTHING you can do
We'll have to wait till he gets back
And a very good morning to you
Haven't checked my calendar but I plan to come
It is byob your own something to barbecue
He thinks he has died and gone to horse heaven
Hi Lee Do you know what the subject of the proceeding is
I'm traveling but will try to get you info
I can't wait to hear the details
I am with Renee tonight but I will be home tomorrow night
Why don't we talk then
Hope you guys had a wonderful weekend at the dome
I ended up a couple hundred or so
This is SO important for us
Maybe you get Lay to put a little pressure on
I'll catch up with Jeff early next week talk to him about the mtg and strategize on next steps
Don't feel we need to elaborate on this at this point possibly in future
Thanks for getting back to me
If we are still working on it next week I will let you know
I totally understand
We need to know if it is too late to become a party if we wanted to
Sorry I haven't replied sooner
There you go again always demanding substance
Will fill you in as things progress
I was worried about this
Sent it Monday night
When do you need and do you want just background or valuation calculations too
I like the idea
If there's anything I can do to help just let me know
Our meetings will be much more effective you attend
Do you want to schedule a quick call tomorrow or friday
Good questions for which I don't currently have answers
It is unlabeled but it is Acacia chard
First I apologize
Not top-shelf enough in my view
If you want to discuss further let me know
Steve Let me know if you'd like to discuss
I like Tim's idea re maybe you should take the slot
But in my view definitely not Skilling
I had only raised it as a thought though and am surprised to see it turn up in print
Do you want to deliver the news to Lee
Do we want to offer you Steve Kean or me as an alternative
Dasovich knows more about this than I do so you should definitely talk to him
Do you think that this is something that Skilling should attend
Tim I know Jeff knows all about the conference we are organizing and I hope you do as well
Thanks very much for your help and advice
Between you and me I don't think California is an option at this point
Mr DeMille would like to know if you're ready for your close-up
I doubt that anyone in accounting has it and I'm not sure to whom in accounting to send it
Also Sue regarding NY I have a call into Bowen but when I called they sounded pretty tied up
I was working from a great first cut
I would recommend however that one of Enron's allies interview for the story
Better if we can approach Intel or Sun now and ask them to talk with R Smith
Hope your son's doing well
One Enron Entity Portland General has published books on its corporate history
If a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it
I did not have prepared remarks but I've attached my talking points
My talking points were not made public however so please keep them private
If you would like a copy please let me know
I apologize for being tardy
I can have my IRS to you by Monday
I won't need a room
Did you want me to participate on a panel
If you have any questions about the retreat please email or call me
I look forward to seeing you all in November
She likes her work but wants a new challenge
Susan would like to keep it confidential at this point
Has Sue gotten in touch with you
And have you contacted Tim Belden in Portland
Lee I'm not certain that it will be possible to get Skilling but I'll get back to you soon
Also I want to manage expectations a bit about the possibility of having Enron stream the conference
Just don't want us to get ahead of ourselves
Thanks for your time and comments
So we're good to go on filing our final tariff
Let me know any issues
Please email Tracy your schedules or preferred times
And are there penalties in place if we don't comply
Scott/Donald/Sue--can we discuss next call
I will incorporate their information when I return from vacation
Please let me know if anyone has any questions or concerns
I think we need to get with some of the other more sane members of the muni community
In my view the best thing that could happen is that it gets ignored and they become further irrelevant
Here are the slides with your suggested edits incorporated
Prentice ever get back to you regarding logistics about tomorrow nite
I think I've got the messages pretty well down but might be useful to touch base
Here's the article that I referred to

I confess that I haven't even looked at the bloody thing
Should we divide them up and pass around as usual

Just need to know so that I can prepare some materials

Gee I don't know what came over me
Darlin' the last thing I want is to be rid of you
Get in touch when you can
On the other hand you aren't rid of me yet
I WILL be a force to be reckoned with out there
I am on the run as usual but will catch up with you
If anyone wants more details just let me know
Whether he has time to incorporate remains to be seen
But I wouldn't sweat it
I assume he'll be sending it out tomorrow
They've asked me to be on a gas panel
I can't place him either
I can't place him

PS When you get a minute give me a call so that we can chat
If you could pass along the template so we can change the services that would be greatly appreciated
Will you get back with us
It was nice to see you and catch up
I'm sorry things are so crazy but in spite of it all your attitude's pretty good
And your new suede jacket is gorgeous
I can help but what's your timing
Jim has mentioned a meeting next week with all of us to talk about strategy etc
In general please contact me before you call on Sarah Joe and Donna with FERC issues
Do you think there is any interest in our participation/intervention
Focus on you
If there's anything I can do to help don't hesitate
I'm still undecided about school still need to have the talk with my contact guy at eLoyalty
I love you sweetie
You didn't run out of gas did you
What's wrong with your email
Sue Nord asked that I forward this to you
CPUC accept our deal on information related to the subpoena
Chris Sorry for the bother but edo you have a an electronic version of the Whaley slides
If so could you email them to me
Could you drop them into power point and forward along
I'll try to add them to what I'm doing
And if there's anything else I can do re your meeting on Monday don't hesitate
I agree with the recommendation
Glad to hear that his rotten bills aren't going anywhere
Hope you and your ankle are doing well
Dave Mary is this your understanding
One last thought If the PUC could do it that might be Davis' preference
That way he and his people are in charge
Did the PUC accept our deal re information from the subpoena
Yes I was thinking of offering up my office
Can we use your office
Let us know if you have any questions
Tuesday it is
If we wait too long it will sneak up on us
Prentice tell you we're coming up tonite
Little spades is in order me thinks
Given that Sue is going to be back on Tuesday you may want to coordinate drafting duties with her
That's actually where it came from
I pulled it from the articles being sent around
Didn't get it the first time
I'll get a hold of Calger for his comments
You can leave messages on my voicemail too
Discard if you already got it
First of all you did a great job
Here are my comments:
Thanks for your efforts in developing this.
Also could you resend the access code for the Craftmade case
I believe that I copied it down incorrectly
If folks have a real problem with that let me know
Also please RSVP so that I can arrange things with building security
Anywho just my two cents
Hope your meetings in Salem went well
Yes I was in Vancouver from last Sunday evening through late yesterday afternoon
Thank you for checking
Are these your calls
Well you don't have voice mail yet I see
Be sure to reserve your place today
Yes it's for finance though you're welcome to join we can use all the help that we can get
I'll buy you a beer
I feel a bit overwhelmed that he's back
I'm going to be in you guessed it Houston
Scotty - maybe that's a line you can use
I have a very mundane question though
If it's annoying the heck out of you
Second please forward to those you know I've missed
Make any changes you like
Sounds like it isn't
Needless to say his advise cost his customers a great deal of money
Rather than acknowledge that he was wrong Robert is on a witch hunt
He is a loud entertaining speaker so I am sure that he will continue to get coverage
Thanks for taking care of it
If in the mean time you have set something up with someone else don't sweat it
They said they could change it
That's a date that I can't change
Please let me if you plan to attend
I received only your subsequent comment that VAT is no problem
Unfortunately I have to get on a plane and go to LA around that time
If it works better we can discuss on Tueday morning/early afternoon
Thanks for staying on us with this one
Could we make the call a little later Monday
But I really want to hear more about the trip
Sounds like it was a blast
Prentice and I were planning on going to the Shea's tonite

One of our potential competitors
Please forward to anyone I may have inadvertently missed
I don't have the email with me
It is in the classroom building I don't remember what room
I'll be there but I have to work in the morning so I may be a little late
Unfortunately we have to keep the date as scheduled
I am very sorry
Also I promise to provide a summary afterwards
Well it's a start but it needs work
See you in LA
Hey I just forgot you haven't sent me the address of where it is I'm going
Yes it did
But I cannot
So I won't take your negative sentiments personally
Cameron Didn't know you asked
Peter de Vroede already teamed me with him
But I am honored to have been considered
It is only for your reference
Could you do me a favor
Enron does not see itself as a generating company
Greetings All If memory serves our filing in California is due on Tuesday
Soon as I get it I'll be distributing for review
Aim would be to have it in shape COB tomorrow
I thought we had discussed me being on the first panel
Thus my previous note

Mary I don't think that I have the final final version
Could send me and Stephanie each one
Can you please send an electronic copy to me
When is your meeting Tom
We need you guys to be ready for messaging this politically
In the event we can get one can I have help rebutting this stuff
I could do it in the morning

Do you have a room-mate for the mid-term retreat
Let me know if you need one
Please get your checks in ASAP
Lysa please contact folks on the above-list to see if they are available
Assuming we can reach critical mass for the call forward AT&T conference calling information to the above-list
Thought it might be the first which I could have made
And should I see if Scott and/or Donald want to attend
Are you speaking
Do you feel lucky
Would you like to participate the option's yours
If you'd like to attend should we call you from the conference room
Donald is on his way back from South America and probably isn't available
Thanks for your enduring patience
Chris Here it is
Shall I forward this to Kathleen or Thom as well
I don't know though I don't think so
I'll forward to you for slashing
I'll believe it when I see it
I'll be in Portland but can call you
Let me know what schedule works for you
Yes I would like to participate
Please let me know if any of you need additional information
You have all devoted considerable time resources and spirit in the preparation of this document - and it shows.
So much for resting on our laurels.
Once again thank you all for an outstanding accomplishment
You still considering it
Here are the messages as I understand them
Can you go
Lord help us
I say we generalize it more
And if you want to take a pass that's of course great too.
Constitutional Crisis here we come
See you at the Alaska gate
Lets go with what we have
Who knows where it may lead
Call if you have questions
Either day's fine with me
Please advise me ASAP your availability for said meeting
If not do you want to meet this weekend for a wee bit to discuss
I will have to send another request
This is the letter in its entirety
We can meet at my office if you'd like or at a cafe
I can meet on the weekend whenever
You can expect it this weekend
So your position to answer your question is unreasonable
As mentioned in a previous note I made that point at the California Energy Market conference last week
I'll forward to you Parquet's notes from the meeting
And for the record Sue no I don't talk like that
Here's my rationale
I'm sure we'll find more issues as we go
I don't we're ready
Mary Please include me in the call with Mr Sanders & Co
Talk to you tonite
Let me >know
Talk to you all soon
Am faxing in case you don't have
If so have they provided any rationale
Do you qualify for the discount on the Reserve too
Quite closed now the dark profile keeps its cards close to the vest
This is my top wine of the year
I am so hurt nancy
Sorry that I missed the last meeting
Thanks and talk to you on Wednesday
Have you drafted any talking points yet
What say you sponsors
I spoke with Borenstein last night
Wayne If you insist we can pass on Thanksgiving
Currently my schedule doesn't permit me to be in Houstons on Wednesday mornings
If it makes things too complicated not a problem
If so it would be nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already approved
I have the ISO market surveillance report
If so please get me a copy and provide a copy of the PX report too
Dave and I talked
Dave Parquet and I spoke with Smutney of IEP re herding the cats
It ain't rocket science and it works
If folks have comments on these points or have others we should discuss with Smutney don't hesitate
I'm sorry I'm losing my mind
Overall we have a very positive relationship and look forward to increasing business
We participated in their only RFP
They did not transact with us or to our knowledge with others
If the utility beats the benchmark it shares the benefits with consumers
If it does worse than the benchmark it shares the pain with consumers
I'd really like to have your input
We can do it at my apartment or anywhere else you folks would like to do it
I will not be in on Wednesday or Thursday so ask for Sarah if you call then
Tomorrow's fine with me
I am going to grind out a spreadsheet tomorrow night
Unfortunately my friends birthday dinner is Thursday night
I know Ted is going to be gone for the weekend
Can we get together tomorrow or over the weekend without Ted
Talk to you on the call tomorrow
Between us we know them all well
Couldn't persuade them to stay in D.C.
Can't they stay in D.C.
How can I get info on deals we've done to you
Did you get my voice mail
Great enthusiasm from everyone I have contacted so far
Look forward to hearing from you
Hope all is going well thus far on your end
Any winery suggestions for my pal
Please sign up on BearTracks if you plan to attend
Hey we meeting tonite
He said that it sounds like a good idea
I told him about our message on price caps
We plan to continue working on it on Monday
We can meet at my meager apartment if you like
Where are we meeting tonight
I think I may have your case study...I have someone's
This means that your Pre-Meeting will occur on Tuesday and not Wednesday
That is fine if you want to to this one
Do you have parking Jeff
Either is fine with me
Please let me know if you'd like to do Opus and I'll get on it pronto
And if you want to do Jarvis call now
I would argue that what happens with PG&E is equally if not more important as what happens with SoCal
In that coalition some of us contributed dollars and some contributed experts
I think we should employ that approach again
Finally if there's anyone else you think we ought to include in our coalition please let me know
If you require some type of estimation sooner than that please let me know
Thank you for your interest in using our services
Great to see you last week
Nice to see you in Houston
Look forward to seeing you again real soon
How you feeling these days
From whom can I get copies of the following presentations
Wow can you believe only a week
Will miss you while you're out
FYI I won't need accomodations
Howzabout Ted cooks and you clean up
Seriously though I'll try to host next time at my humble apartment
I thought we did a good job of cranking things out
And if you get a chance could you give a ring
I don't have anything from Gil Muhl
If anyone is interested in filling it please let me know
Good to see you in Vancouver
Here are the reports that I referred to
Shoot me a reply yo this message if all is well
I look forward to seeing Prof Littlechild at the conference on Monday
Do either of you konw how I might get a copy
Got your voicemail
Will call you as soon as I'm able
Simon - Can you e-mail these to Jeff
It gets real crowded sometimes which causes them to close the gates
Later it gets crazier it gets
Let me know any questions.
Please keep me tightly in the loop about any conversations activities etc
Unfortunately I need to reschedule
It's taking up a considerable amount of my time these days
I would be happy to reschedule for next week
Wed-Fri Just let me know
I just sent you a note
I apologize but I need to reschedule
Just let me know what works for you
Again my apologies and I look forward to meeting next week
Please let me know if this works for folks
And if it does work Ginger could you set up a call-in number
When do I need to sign up by
Sounds like all in all it was a good meeting
Thank you - it's been great working with you
You are definitely one the most intelligent hardest working individuals I have had the pleasure of working with
I apologize if I offended anyone
Please let them know that I was simply quoting the CEO of a large regulated utility in California
Thanks for attributing the quote to me
Thank you for the note
How long will you be visiting
You coming diving with me and Shea tomorrow
You gotta do it man
Many of them did ask for another ballot and were told they couldn't have one
Did anyone get them
Please let me know if you get this one
That's a great idea and I think that it would be useful to meet with her
I'll look into setting up a meeting with her
She's been unable in past to control Peace at her hearings
I think that Sue also has a conflict
Actually you were supposed to sign up by friday but I'll get you on the list now
I'm sorry I'm losing my mind.
So we thought it unnecessary for Enron to seek to speak
Jeff mentioned the new firm we hired as a possibility
I can meet during the break
I am pretty suspect about PG&E though
He thinks that CMTA/CLECA probably don't like it but they will be in the minority
Although we all recognized that the rules around reasonable behavior were preventing utilities from entering into contracts
The utility could set a price up front and have to manage its costs to meet that price
Another way is competitive bid for portions of its portfolio
Please let me know your availability or what day and time would be more convenient
Believe it or not in the past I would have been much more aggressive about it
Sorry if it made things well fidgety
Too bad we had to wash it down with that discussion
Anyway let me know what I can do for Prentice's birthday
Let me know about deposits and stuff like that as well
Got your message re PR firm
Would love to have you two join but worry not if you've got conflicts
Thank you very much for the summary
Sorry I was out of the office all day
Hope you got there
Don't mean to overload you
When you get a chance to give me that info I'd greatly appreciate it
I don't have any number
On Friday the Assembly failed to get its version of the Edison MOU out of the appropriations committee
Once created we can work with Jeff on action items
I trust this initiative will further enhance an already effective procedure
If there are any questions let me know
Call when you can
Hope given the circumstances that all finds you well
And speaking of up our stock's up today
Keep your fingers crossed
Was it in yesterday's gas daily
If so I can access it
Sue and Jeanne Bennett discussed and thought coalition filings would be preferable but let's talk about it
Have we spoken with Mike Smith about providing our customer/contract information
Do you have a number for him
What day do you want
I don't understand the netting that you are referring to
How about if my aloe vera plant models it instead
I have not spoken to him directly in a while
Possible to get it from you
Did he change companies or just phone numbers
I'm going to call him today
I will confirm meeting time
I'm trying to track him down
Should we include Becky Cantrell on these calls
Let me see what I can do
So this is all about sourcing or are you aiming higher
I was hoping to have the meetings with Deal Bench this week but that probably won't happen
Will that work for your deal bench guy
If you would like a copy of the letter please send your fax number to Joseph Alamo
I definitely want to move forward
Ready to start when you are
Really appreciate your efforts
Hope all finds you well
The best way to save consumers money she suggested is to renegotiate the state's energy contracts
If California had not purchased too much power consumers would not have to pay for it she said
I think I'm at Stanford that evening
How'd you hurt your back
Another day I guess
I am terribly disappointed but it wouldn't be wise
I hope the trip is wonderful
Sorry that some of you won't be making it to Mendocino
Dear folks Hope all finds you well given the circumstances
If there are any charges please let me know
Hope to see all of you very soon
Lu I'll call you after I talk to Jeff to confirm whether he's still going
I assume that the trip to Mendocino is still going forward
Sadly I may have to pass on Mendocino
I will get back to you by Wednesday
I am sorry for the lateness of the draft but these are not extensive comments
I look forward to your comments
You want to handle or you want me to take a stab at it
Hi Jeff Among other things Community Relations is here to help the business units drive their business
Misha is the person who can help you with this
Best Jeff Hi Elyse I work in government affairs in San Francisco
Surprisingly refreshing to hear that Massey put it to them
Ed GArvey/Minnesota he got the gold star for the day

In its decision denying the Petitions the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects
If you would like a copy of the decision please contact Joseph Alamo
Jeff Thanks in advance for your help with this
Seriously he and I have traded messages today
When we hook up I'm going to ask him when we can meet and get this settled
He's out today and will call me back tomorrow
Thanks for your patience
See you tomorrow night in the tah moh
He suggested that we start without lawyers
I said that we could do that but that I'd have to check
I can be on
You want me to join
Probably too early for you guys
This is from Sue's draft she gave me Jim will get a copy in the a.m
Did we send this
Jim For your comments
Do you want to do this
Regardless your insights would be quite useful and welcome
Is there someone who Ross works for that I could contact
That ain't gonna do it in my view
I'm going to call Tribolet and get his thoughts
I'll let you know what he says
In their most recent BCAP they do propose to implement a customer-only open season on their backbone
I can check on that
Can you tell me if that is true
Elizabeth Let me know it this works or if you need anything else
Let me know when you can fit it in your schedule
Greatly appreciate your help
Yes I have known her for quite some time
I will be happy to make the introduction
Shall I make arrangements for a meeting in Pebble Beach
Do you know her
Are you playing golf
I'll get to it though
Appreciate your patience
Zach Streight - he has both a business and technical background
If we do we need to send out a notice to the key business people
Be useful to find out if she knows him
But I'm not sure what it is
OK We should tell you brother
Does he use email
Thanks very much for your help on this
I got the faxes
I will fax them as soon as I get them
Mark yelled at the guy and the editors sliced it down
Karen can you and I talk briefly before you call Ken
The recommendation is now before the full Commission which we expect will rule by mid-October
I just talked to Kip Lipper--works for Byron Sher but Burton relies on him alot
Let's take a little time and get it right
Don't break your back but would be very good if we could arrange it
If you need me to track him down just let me know
I was trying to get the number from Barry
Can you email us the call in # and room
Give a call when you get in
Don't yank my chain
I need to get this into Rick by Wednesday
Alan Please take a look and pass any comments along to me
Pure and simple it is a scheme that the PUC must declare unconstitutional
The PUC must vigorously defend its role
Looking at their track record the answer is no
According to our courts the power to set taxes is a legislative function
Drivers purchasing gas in California pay the tax on a cents per gallon basis whenever they buy gas
The Legislature has directed DWR to purchase power as it needs at prices it is willing to pay
For all of our sakes and the future of our state this must not be allowed to happen
I see the cite now
Thanks for your time as well
We're doing our best to help
Thanks and see you soon
Could you leave your phone number on my work voice mail
Call me when you get in on sat
Once I gat an idea of what you want I can get a good idea of the cost
Let me know what time you can meet this weekend
Edison has been reaching deals with some of its creditors but has kept others waiting
PG&E took itself into bankruptcy in April
Could it be ours as well
Man were you all over NPR or what with that Telco story
Give my best to Tina
Hey Great to hear from you
I was just going to call you
Give me a ring sometime
Please let me know how else we can help
Thank you so much for this information
It is EXTREMELY helpful to our efforts
Thank you so much for the quick response
Leslie -- Funny you should ask
We'll report back when we get additional information
Did you folks ever send a letter to the PUC
If so is it possible to get a copy
So I'm assuming that you support the plan
Let me know if there's anything we can do
Jeff- Should I contact Tim Hamilton or have you already done this
Also--if you could help me find where in the websites the information is that would be helpful
I am uncertain however whether this is the correct name or entity
I haven't heard from him for quite some time
Thanks to you both for you help
Apparently they don't have it
From our side please include Sue and Rick and me
Well then this event is for you
I will contact you regarding payment
I asked him what sort of deals they're working on
I suggest someone from Enron definitely attend
Would you please see if they= post a more detailed version of the proposal and if so distribute
Attached is the program listing speakers and their bios

Please call me if you wish to discuss
While legislators toiled Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds
I agree with many of the points John makes but I don't want to be identified with the letter
Marcus has briefed them and it's a go
I will be quoted along the lines of the letter but at this point I'm in no hurry
I appreciate your support with Hap though very much
I don't mind taking risks but I don't want to precipitate a palace coup led by Calpine
Unless I hear from you I'm telling Hap that it's fine
Thanks again for taking care of it
I'll try to scan the invoice and send to you
I left a check on the kitchen counter
Or possibly worse would they now be under BOTH jurisdictions
Anything you get on this developing story would be interesting
With respect to Hap John's asked me to hold off talking to him until John signals
Call Hap and tell him I said he should back off
Commissioner Bilas then spoke for his alternate responding to Wood
He sa= id he had learned how to count and he can count to three
He then briefly= summarized his alternate
Second he indicated his view of DA was a lot different from= that of other people
Therefore there is no question = that it has to be suspended
In conclusion we have prevailed in our opposition to retroactive direct ac= cess suspension
We now need to consider whether we want to contest the su= spension itself on legal/procedural grounds
If you don't want to add this class please let me know right away

Do we have any recent presentations position papers memos etc
Kind of generic but I am putting together a presentation for potential investors in CA deals
Can you fax the order
Work kept me away
Do I need to be doing anything
We were expecting you in Competitive Strategy last night
Are you taking that class
I absolutely could not BELIEVE that he sent this note
WHERE does this guy get his DOPE
Jeff Jim Jeff and Tim I hope all is well
If so I am asking for your support
Work prevented me from going to class at all last nite
Does the course seem like it will be good
Good to see you the other night
Just let me know if you want to add another class but you may not have the time
Just ask at our front desk and we'll make you a copy of your latest transcript
The bill failed passage during its prior hearing
No issues at my end
Please let me know if you have any issues with this
Please let me know of your availability for this call
We can discuss the results on our conference= call tomorrow
Later this afternoon or tomorrow afternoon work well for = me
The above requirement indicates that it is not
Will get back to you
I responded to the questions posed in the agenda
Rick Jim and Rob would you mind looking over this attachment and adding your thoughts
Some passed some failed and most of them served to further confuse the committee members
Subsequently Hedy and I spoke to D.J
Also we spent some time with Lenny Goldberg on direct access
Jeff Karen wanted me to ask you about this article
Did you get it off the actual Wall Street Journal website
Let me know when you get a moment
Just last year Wall Street analysts and media praised his bold makeover plan
Mr McCaughy says his spending plans are on hold
Prices have begun to come down but the mine is still shut
Mr Gannon scoffs at the notion that his company made the wrong move
When it does Touch America could have an advantage over its debt-laden competition
I'd propose that we continue with Edison
Good talking to you
I'll be accompanying him
I don't think there's anything that would disqualify any plants
I should have copied you on my original email
Jeff what are your thoughts for affecting this language
Do you read it the same way
I'd do it if you needed to

I think that day is fine from a childcare perspective
Jeff you OWE me
Can I distribute to the business groups
Jeanne is getting back to me on the legal arguments

Please clarify that I have understood this correctly
Thanks a lot for your assistance
If the group comes up with an action that it believes makes good sense Mirant will participate
The Commission postponed its consideration of the draft decision
However we do not change the effective date of the suspension
I presume we will want to file in strong opposition
No have not heard back from him yet
Mark Did you get a copy of this from Mike Day
Got calls in to them
And yes you spelled them correctly
Did I spell those names right
Anyway just let me know
I am still waiting for his confirmation
In case you hadn't seen it
But it ran into immediate opposition from Gov
The state has been buying power for PG&E since January when it became insolvent
The same should be true for most employees he said
The latest salvo -- see -- we started something
I just got it
I'll fax it
That is the best apple pie I have ever had
Thank you so much Jeffrey!!!!!!!!
She called me
Could you get the address and email it to me Christina and Dave Parquet
I'm going to call you to discuss
Once they did Jones asked federal and state regulators to investigate possible insider trading and conflicts of interest
I have not heard back from him
I think you can pass
Do you know what this call is for
And should I be on it
She and I can get info for you today
Per below Jim thought you might be able to help with this if Sue is on vacation
I think that Sue is still on vacation
I'll get it right out to you by fax
Can you please get with Sue
I assume you're all over this Linda
On the off chance that you haven't seen it
I think we would have some concerns with her proposal
If you want to pass along our comments to IEP just get them to me
As a result it was an extremely hectic day
I do intend to make the weekly calls
Great to see you
Really glad you guys joined in
But I would say that Loretta not Brown was the winner and will continue to be the winner
I saw Brown this morning
He's pissed and he called Loretta a liar
Somehow he knew what was going to happen and he prevented it
Sure you've seen it but just in case
Non-energy-related friend of mine emailed it to me
PS Where's my email Ms Perfect
I'll set it up
I will get back to you today
Being a patent maven and auction babe thought you might find interest in this
Here we go again
Dave is this anything you want us to engage in
Jim what do you think about this
Anyway we will be discussing this further at the Regulatory Affairs conference call next Tuesday
They'll do all the pounding needed on their own
Comnes will be sending it in a minute or two
It looks very good to me and I've added it
If you're taking it could you let me know what the assignment is for Tuesday
I'm on vacation and the course hasn't yet been added to my Izio account
Best wishes in reacclimating yourself to school
Heck who needs them anyway
Just you guys going up to visit right
I will send you the email later today
We are going to Napa next weekend so I really didn't want to go up twice
I will be sure to send some flowers
Fielder said that they believe their argument is solid
If you have any questions between now and then give a holler
I had sent this message to Justin Bradley last week but have not heard back from him
I should have sent it to you also
I hope that things are going well with you
I could use your help
I would need specific engine information as indicated above
Please telephone or e-mail me if you have any questions
Thanks very much for your consideration
Well we had the right person handling the call that's for sure
What should we do
Hey we kid
Where'd we be without our humor
On another note I thought the Hoover conference was extremely good
What was your impression
It was good to see you
However I sent you a copy with a few egregious typos

How's things going out there on your end--settling down at all
I saw the letter from Peace to CalPERS
Therefore I'm not sure if we gain anything by responding or taking other action
I don't envy Karen for her job at the moment
I also don't think they're planning too far in advance
I've got a couple of CPUC questions for you
Is it likely that it is still being compiled
How do you get on the agenda
Since I'm basically on call I probably won't dial in unless someone gives me a reason
Anyone there you would recommend as a point of contact/entry
It was great to talk to you today
That work for you
And when it happens I can conference folks in using my phone
What's your direct dial
Aida Please review the attached documents and let me know if this answers your gas questions
I'll conference folks in from my phone
We need to start figuring out as soon as possible What we want to accomplish at the hearing
What our posture/message will be
That's why I was calling
Rather small player at that as best as we can tell
Hey you guys having fun yet
Did you watch the game last night
Overall looks great though I made a few edits/comments
But I couldn't figure out how to do it in strikeout/underline
Will you get stuff for breakfast at Rainbow
Which means DA customers would pay twice for power--once to their ESP and now again to Edison
Is this something that your clients care about
Do any of you want to see copies
I will call you first think Monday to discuss
Well it was too brief and I didn't get to work with you nearly as much as I'd hoped
But when I did it was very enjoyable
Glad you had a good time
Today looks pretty good for me to try to do it
I know that this is probably a pain but it seems like that's information that we need to know
I'll report back just as soon as we do
O boy I feel another planting binge coming on
Hey we're likely going to the Dome this weekend so you're likely going to have put with seeing us
I'll get back to you soon as we hook up
Heard about your plan
We'll call you
He could surprise us
I'll let you know either way
Jerry Bloom left me a message
Wants to talk though I wouldn't get my hopes up
Thanks for your efforts thanks for trying and thanks for your strong sense of decency
If there's anything whatsoever I can do to assist don't hesitate
I am deeply saddened and angry at what has occoured but it's beyond my control to fix
Now I see why you were asking
Could you forward Dan's draft
I strongly urge that we NOT push this into this proceeding
Please review and get back to me with comments by the close of the day if possible
We'll do it when you're ready
We're still here just to let you know
We still plan on doing your project but I can't leave the current one until finished
I will stay in touch
I'm thinking that if I let the big customers know perhaps that'll give them an incentive to sign on
We can take it or leave it
If there's anything else let me know
In particular I need the gas market characteristics in these states
We appreciate your explaining this restriction to such parties
Thank you for your patience
Wow based on the share price it appears they're having significant difficulty finding additional sources of funds
By the end of the week our share price may be lower than Edison's
When do you want to call Hedy and Bev
Sue can you make sure that Jeremy and team have a synopsis and outline of next steps
I will keep you apprised
To be honest I was concerned--given how wide-ranging it was--that I might step in something unintentionally
Please let me know if I do/did
I'll get back to you today
Houston is dealing with some pretty big issues but I'm going to push them to meet with you nonetheless
I hope things are going well
Hi Brad I finally got in touch with the people from Perfect
Either of those days work for you
I'll let them know
Lots--and I mean lots--going on
I think that realistically we're talking December
At this point it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings
Please provide details of this as soon as it happens
Just let me know if it changes
April Could you please distribute this to the office
Well here's a chance to take your mind off of things
If you're interested please let me know ASAP
It is rumored that a Legislative Counsel opinion questions its constitutionality
Both bills are in their second houses but are two-year projects
The bill is now on its way to the Governor
I'll try to rustle-up some press accounts of his remarks
Soon as we get the transcript we'll fill you in
So where is his great statement on DA
Thanks I'd love them
I'm good for it
Think I missed the bidding
If this won't work just let me know
Is there any way all of us can play golf tomorrow
If anyone has any questions just let us know
And then there's your family which is the most important thing
SO sorry I passed out
Man I just suddently hit the wall
If you guys are uncertain that's no problem
Just need you to understand that I'm moving ahead
Are you guys hip on sharing the cost of getting appraisals
Everyone needs to feel comfortable with where they are etc
Hi Josh Sorry to bother you
Are they an ARM member
I left Janie a very pointed e-mail on this topic
They have no customers receiving commodity from them so I guess in the short term they are not harmed
I simply wanted to get it on the radar screen
Whenever you get a free minute give me a ring and we can talk about it further
Could you re-email the ARM press release re supreme court
I want to distribute it around a bit
You think I should submit the reimbursement now before the semester ends just to get it in the door
Yes we are covering the meeting
And I bet she would feel the same way
I'll be at your place on Thursday to see her
Thought I'd add Eldon too since he likely has some ideas and information too
Hi Sorry to bug you--know things are crazy--but just checking in on the presentations we talked about yesterday
And who else do we expect on the call
Won't have it expand beyond that unless Belden Vicki or Janet specifically want someone else
I'm at my desk
He got me
OK Jim trying to call you now
Mark your diary today
Thanks a million for your help on this
I'll give you a ring tomorrow to discuss further
Man for someone who doesn't know much you sure know alot based on the note you sent
It's your call on today's lesson
If you're feeling under the weather then we can pass for today
I think I understand the procedure now
What sorts of things do they like
If something crops up we can set up a call to discuss
I can take it from here
I'll let you know if anything interesting comes up
The very best of luck to you
I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E however
Dan I wanted to follow up on our discussion last week regarding the peaker we're helping Lodi to develop
If we do it Sunday morning I'm game
Yeah I found this out last night as was going to tell you about it
I haven't read it yet
It may be what we need
I don't know that it is ABS
Greetings Left you a voicemail over the weekend
Will call later Greetings Left you a voicemail over the weekend
Can we talk this week on our response
I'll give you a ring to discuss more
If you have any questions comments etc
But what can I do
I have to practice law
I thought you folks were involved in this program and supported it but I may have it all wrong
Is anything you care about and/or have a position on
Give me a little time and I'll get you some names
What's your timeframe
Got your email from Scott
I'm hoping you can do me a favor
I'd be forever in your debt
You know there are rumors flying around about you in London
Jeanne Do you have a copy of the procurement OIR
Could you email it to me if you do
Folks are going to oppose it very strongly
About three other bonfires cropped up after I talked to you
If you have any other questions just let me know
I'm damned proud to be associated with you and hope= to continue in the future
If we don't get a chance to talk between now a= nd tomorrow have a great Thanksgiving
And Rick I'm not a very religious= guy but god bless you
In that memo I included a quote that went as follows
We even had a= good time doing it
So sorry to hear about your nose
How bad is it
We're anxious to start meeting with them
If so how have they reacted
And yes we'll take the victories when we can get them
I read Karl's ruling on the contracts
Just about had it with that bozo
Hey man you feeling any better
First forget it all and have a wonderful holiday
Do you know if he got it
I will attend the following hearing next Monday
Here's our assessment of Wright's performance in California
If you need any other information just let me know
Yes I will keep you all posted
Once you get a chance to look at give a call and let me know what you think
Really appreciate all your help
Greetings I just talked to Marcie
Can you forward me both
I'll take a look at them
Hi Jeff...I have an intro letter and the presentation that we typically give on our first visit
Do you think one of those might be appropriate or shall I put together something in between the two
Not that I don't very much enjoy reading it
Brown going to vote for it
Greetings Ms Denne Hope your holiday was restful and relaxing
Could someone in your shop try to dig that up
Congratulations again on your new role at Anaheim
Elena tells me that you're having a great time
Thanks very much for your hospitality and a really fun time
If you have openings that you would like to advertise to these students please let me know
Thanks very much for getting the contracts for me
Soon as there is a draft that folks have reasonably agreed to I'll send it to you
If you have any questions give a holler
Can't make the call but concur that we ought to stay where we were
Not that the proposal doesn't merit discussion but it raises many issues and we're down to the wire
So I concur with Bill and Aaron
Perhaps we should try to regroup first thing in the AM
Unfortunately Aaron and I will not be able to make this call
Jim was out yesterday and today but I think that he'll be in tomorrow
All I spoke with the customer Mike Benson
He is not angry but he would like his accounts returned to bundled service
He knows to contact me directly with future issues
I have also notified the SBC contracts manager of the situation
Let me know if there are any questions or concerns
Thanks again for getting to the bottom of it
Let me know if I should contact anyone
How can I answer his question below
Is this something we have done
Hope that you had a good holiday
Jeff Belden asked me to look into this
I assume you are too
Hope you weathering things ok
Ultimately I and just about everyone else am going to need to find a new job
But it is what it is
As for me I'm dusting off my resume and getting ready to send it around
Definitely crazy times but I'm not getting to worked up about it
Love to have tea just let me know when
How you doing
I'm reading terrible things about Enron - is it affecting you
Not sure if anything will come of it but I'll let you know
He always gets back to me
Thank you both very much for your help on this
Should you have any questions please contact your Human Resources Representative
Thank you for your cooperation and patience
Scott could you let Ken know of the plan
I'll submit them just as soon as I get them
Have a nice weekend despite it all
Should you have further questions please let me know
Can you confirm
Could I stay in SF and work for NEG
And people don't really hate me do they
You should call him
A regulah laugh riot that's what she is
Prentice you're the best birthday present I could ever have--even better than money
That's what his next birthday present is going to be
Thanks and ditto my friend
An= d it shows
I am as grateful as one can be
The work that we did here was great
Thank you so much for all you've done for Annie
She's fine with it
All the very best to you and yours
I'll call you very soon
Love to work on it together if possible
Give a call when you get a minute
Where have you heard that
And what is it saying
Jeff Is Enron going to welch on their deals
Please forgive me for not getting back to you more promptly
At least through the end of the year it appears
If you'd like their contact information I'd be happy to provide it
HOWEVER your calls and nice thoughts are extremely welcomed and greatly appreciated
Will talk to you soon and hope you're doing well
Whichever way you prefer is fine by us
I'll let you know how she responds
Hey I can't open this
Please don't hesitate to contact IEP if you have any questions
While we have sufficient funds to continue the pending electric study at present we are unsure of Enron's desires
Take a peek and let me know what you think
Let me know if there's anything else
Greetings Professor I regret that I was unable to attend class last night
Or if you'd like to make some other arrangement just let me know
Here's my take
From my perspective there is very little value in that activity
But if Scott ain't interested he ain't interested
That's my take
Let me know if I'm missing something here
Again apologize for keeping on about it
Yes we can schedule
Do you know who all would participate
I think we would definitely be interested
But don't worry I have extremely low expectations about the likelihood of getting reimbursed
I'm glad we were wrong
Ain't got it yet
I just had coffee with a former business colleague
Are you interested in talking to her
Should be coming over your fax machine any minute
I plan to turn the final in tomorrow
Thank you so much for a wonderful night on Friday
So you're the one who gave me this cold
I will remember
Melinda Pharms who has primarily worked with Becky Cantrell in the past has been joining our calls
I already forwarded to her the message about the rescheduled call
Well I tried
Looks like you'll have to give them to your Neanderthal friend
Now I have to wipe the tears off my keyboard
I don't know what shape I'll be in but if there's an opening = maybe I can make it
Thank you for your understanding and we hope to hear from you at o= ur new address
I'm not sure I understand the reference
Just--a--hold your breath shut your eyes and pucker up I always say
If you and Prentice are interested I might be able to get you tickets
Please let me know that you've received them
And thanks for sending them along to Nancy
Please send me a copy of the OII if you can
Eldon you were particularly nice to let me win at just about everything we did
No worries on getting back to me
Talk to you in a couple days
Thanks als for the calls last week or was it the week prior
So far so good although I hope that the ees sales team can get a deal done soon
I hope that you are hanging in there
I'm not sure but I have a sneaking suspicion that all you folks are finished this semester
Hope all is OK or at least as OK as it can be
Hope given these wild times that all is well with you and yours
Can you imagine going through this twice
Also couldn't believe it when I saw Frank Lindh in the news
My heart goes out to him
Thanks for forwarding them along
Hope you guys are done soon too
Could you confirm that you've received it
Gee sure was nice of Andy Fastow to wish us all happy holidays
Any way for me to get a hold of Scott
For these reasons we must respectfully dissent
Jeff If you think its useful can you forward this information to IEP
My server advised me that this did not go out so I am resending it
I hope you will not have received two notices and apologize if you did
Ain't got a chance to call him yet but will do so by COB today
Agree we need to get it nailed down period
By the way please give me a report back after you talk to Pat
We'll confirm whatever you get out of him in writing
I was trembling
I mean it read like a chilling cold-war spy novel
I think they spelled Stout's name right--several times
That makes at least two of us
I love their attitude and their words
Not surprising but thought you might be interested
I responded that letting go is a good thing
Let me know if that covers gold on Saturday
If there's anything that I can do to help don't hesitate
As you know having gone through Sandi I'm extremely sensitive to inter-group relations
If you feel there are issues that we should discuss I'd really like to do it
From my perspective I feel strongly that I haven't behaved that way and don't in any way intend to
For a variety of reasons I have been asked to take on alot of tasks over the past year
Talk to you at noon your time
Why did you schedule this so Sue Mara could'nt be on
Jeff- Hey got your voicemail this morning - sorry about that
I am in = the office- give me a jingle
Dorothy if you can get it to the DA Coalition that would be great
Jeff asked that I send this to you
Love to have you with us
If you could get it to all the usual suspects that would be great
If there's any issues with that approach just let me know
Give a call when you get a chance
Also I don't enjoy playing against people who always lose--unless I'm playing ping pong golf or Spades
Please add to/subtract from this list and then I'll take a shot at fleshing it out
Please add anything I may have missed send it back and I'll take a shot at fleshing it out
I think these are the areas we identified
Welcome back all of you veteran pickers
However all you need to send back is the sheet for the current week
If that's the case do we have a forwarding telephone number for him
Did I tell you that Fawcett left for greener pastures
Let me know if you need a copy of the application
You saw my previous email
Jeff can you forward this to Jeff Fawcett
I must have the wrong email address for him and the message was rejected
See you tomorrow nite
See you Tuesday
We'll report back with any additional information that we hear
Can you send the draft letter Tracy refers to re letter to legislators
When are we filing our appeal
He believes his interests are aligned with Jeremy's
Winter defied his own board and Gov
The generators got their way
He didn't mention anything about it
Prices he said did not spike as a result
In my discussions with generators so far there has been some flexibility on contract length
Is it difficult to integrate wind into your portfolio
A wind farm generates electricity when the wind blows not when you flip the switch on
Those predictions underlie our contracts
Are you working on other approaches
How big might your renewable portfolio get
Will you keep signing more contracts for new projects
Perhaps most importantly we need consumers to buy the wind energy
Greg Good talking to you
Based on our call I contacted Perfect Commerce
Let me know if that works for you and Brad
Or if you'd like to contact them directly just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails
From what I hear it's going well and EES is enthusiastic
Glad you guys can meet with them
Add them to the petition for rehearing
CMTA will be back to me soon
I'll let you know what I hear back
Hopefully they will actually respond
We hope that you can join
I look forward to seeing your comments
Although California will be allowed to heal it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO
Therefore he asked Staff to prepare a presentation which they made at the meeting this morning
Despite the strong arm tactics it appears that Brown may be the only aye vote at this point
We'll report back with news as we get it
I spoke to the three primary Senate consultants dealing with energy
In fact Senate staff is continuing to prepare for their annual golf excursion next Tuesday
And he recalled that then-Gov
Could I get your fax numbers
Would like to get your comments once you've reviewed the argument
This would be a project that we my guys and I would take on not just a side job
I propose we do the job on a T& M basis which is essentially all I do anymore
You should have it already
Give me a call when you get a minute
I'll forward to them
Still Wiggs said even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated it was not excessive
Freeman repeatedly said the utility's prices were high because it was forced to use its most costly inefficient plants
DWP insists it is outside the commission's jurisdiction
Do you know anything about this
Can you offer any insights
Hope you'll be able to hire someone to replace you given your new responsibilities
For what it's worth I concur with Mike
Please let me know your thoughts asap
If we need to have a quick call I can set something up
When you guys going to the dome
SO we should target early November for this meeting
Can you help facilitate that
What did you think of PP's hair
I was shocked
I pushed this date way out
We can easily push it out more
Don't think it's anything that raises any concerns but since you're signing on thought you might want to peruse
Really truly I intend to be quite normal and no fuss
This is good for me
It's only been described to me by their General Counsel
Tell them OK
The funniest thing is that Prentice has always said that she hates rice and therefore risotto
However it's safe to say that all concerned believe that your comparably quality and well-equipped to fill his shoes
Hope to see you on the golf course soon
If in fact they actually come back next week we'll likely stay with Tues/Thur
But we're still figuring and will get back to you
SOmeone was supposed to call you yesterday
We'll be setting up a call-in number for it
I also agree
We'll report back with information as we get it
Mike can you set up a meeting for Wednesday morning
Sue Can you meet with Brown/Gamson
I would recommend we try for both
Tell them to do what PG&E did in their reorg
Hey but when are you going to the dome tomorrow
Did you folks have a call today
Any issues that you believe affect our commercial efforts in California
Thanks - look forward to your input
How about we get you on the line next week
Feel free to send it along
But as you know things are somewhat difficult these days
I'll get it to the right people however
I want my money back
Prentice please get your stuff out of my apartment
So what place are we in
Did you have a marvelous time
Did they like the tomatoes
Just because they like direct access
Call me if you would like to discuss
If you are asked these amounts are directly from the utility bills not an Enron's calculation
Let me know what you think or if you need anything else
If you follow Rick's suggestion it might be a short meeting anyway
Thanks very much for all your help
Can I call you tomorrow morning to discuss
Please remove them from the list of signatories
I'll call you in the afternoon
I will be here all day
At this point appears they intend to go forward
I don't see an issue with this
I believe that it's the equivalent of a state historian
I'd like to talk to you about Mr Tycholiz and gas stuff
We welcome your input
I understand the need to keep powder dry
Jeff Sorry I just got to dealing with this
I assume it's being filed today and I don't have client authority to support
When you say things aren't looking good do you mean for DA or for SCE
I still need to talk to you
I thank you in advance for your consideration Joseph Alamo Sr
Please let us know if the list looks about right
You may see something in the press about it
See my and Sue's email
Don't you think
I talked to the LA Times McGraw Hill and Bloomberg
McGraw Hill talked to Dynegy and their comments were similar to ours
For his part Gov
The contracts tamed the market and eliminated the blackout threat he said
You get your money out in three years
Another weakness of the contracts Marcus said is that they lock the state into further dependence on gas
Windmills and solar panels would help buffer against natural gas price spikes he said
Renewable sources of power also don't release air pollution and gases that contribute to global warming he added
Consider me reminded
Whatever you're doing keep it up baby
Keep doing it man
Davis is likely losing his mind
Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts he said
But federal action could help the state improve the deals he said
John's asked me not to intervene at this point
Great working with you
What if we started offering some better deals
Hey my mind is wide open sir
I'm hooting just thinking about it
Could we get someone else to do it
You're right but what a hoot it would be
Might be a good idea to talk with him in advance
I don't think that he'll want to pick on Calif
I took a quick look
Wednesday looks good for me
Wed afternoon would work for me
Does this sound good to you two
Here's a chance to make your dreams a reality
Do you want to send someone
In return we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC
Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal but had to check back on his end
If I see him I'm going to get all over him
But me thinks the contracts are in for a wild ride
Can you work with Sue and set up a call for Wed afternoon
I talked to Loretta today
Printing distribution and use of this material is governed by your Subscription Agreement and copyright laws
I invited Jim S
I was assuming that Paul would facilitate
Paul can you make this meeting
If not Paul I was assuming it would be Sue or you
Sort of chokes you up
If not Paul could you resend
Please stop by when you get a minute
We're as glad as anybody that it hasn't happened
Thanks for your time and hope all is well

For you anything
I know your swamped and focused on other things
Here are my additions
Tried to turn around quickly so I apologize in advance for errors
If anyone has questions don't hesitate to let me know
Once again I've had my inadequacies pointed out and highlighted for all
You get your glasses
When we gonna get together again for a Spades massacre
When do you want the wine
Will advise with info as it happens
With the vote it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts
If you have any questions just let us know
I assume you heard about what happened at the PUC today
I think it classfies as amazing
Christine Jun from our office will be heading this effort
Could you please email to her a final of your application which we apparently have not yet received
Dan Could you send along the ARM/WPTF filing
Sorry you didn't get a copy Evie
What have you done with Loretta
I was amazed
Gotta hand it to Loretta Lynch
You would really make our day if your answer is yes
Therefore I am rescinding my call for the Third Extraordinary Session
Please ignore my earlier email
Please keep to yourself at this point
Whenever it's convenient for you
Just let me know and let me when you need the check and for how much
Many of you responded and I want to share the survey results with you
I sincerely appreciate your participation
Now here's what we're going to do based on your feedback
We are all concerned about our stock price which has declined significantly this year
These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution wholesale and retail businesses
However business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently
Finally we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes
We believe the stock price our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale
We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year
I believe as I said previously we need to reinforce our core values particularly integrity and respect
From what you have told us in this survey you agree
If you would like to participate in these focus groups please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson
But we would ask for your commitment too
I have to clear with Calger first
Am I reading this right
Are they straight gas deals
Tim asked me to forward this to West Desk traders
Frankly I find any partisan activity at this juncture to be petty and deplorable
There's no room for politics in my view period
We are all suffering tonight but others suffer more than we do
Let us help them
Let us suspend our grievances for a brief time to focus on the well-being of our fellow human beings
We will have purified ourselves to a degree and will then be more fit for direct action
Here's how you can help
Thank you Robert for pointing that out
Don't hate me for sending a note
That's what we did in California
Houston is definitely the brain but you need all the other limbs and organs to function well
That allowed us to coordinate extremely well under challenging conditions
Thanks a millino for your help
I can make it
Any questions please contact me
Best Jeff We'll see you tonite for the bluegrass filming
I will inform you later as to the meeting location
Thanks and I will keep in touch

Figured they'd contacted them but wanted to make sure
I apologize I'm on the road and haven't heard when that will be
I'm thinking that I may want to attend
I can dig it up if you'd like
Can we discuss this today or soon thereafter
The motivation to do so could grow soon he added
Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis Shames said
For his part the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts
But we have not been approached by anyone
Why don't we ask
That why we get paid the big bucks
While not preferable to conventional generating plants they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service
If California can build new more efficient ones it can retire the old polluting ones the argument goes
We did what we could
Gray Davis help that he badly needed--but left him upstaged
Such actions have made her perhaps Davis' least favorite appointee
At her direction PUC General Counsel Gary Cohen made the initial call to Edison
In their view past inaction by the commission had helped bring the firm to the brink of bankruptcy
Word of the talks could stampede creditors into forcing the utility into bankruptcy they feared
Lynch did notify her fellow commissioners whose support she would need to pull off a settlement
Knowing that Lynch opposed the proposal the governor tried to create a majority that would bypass her
He has not been offered the post and does not want it Brown said

I would have been happy to let you have it
You still can you know
But if that's a bother don't worry about it--we can do it another time
So did I
Thank you for the check - I appreciate it
I was actually kind of hoping you wouldn't want it
When would you be around to pick up your other wine
I would bet that we'll be there
I'll bring my check book
If it is it's worth it
We'll see you Sunday
Davis needs to dump them but if he acts directly he'll have to admit that he made a mistake
Davis appointed his own five-member board
Oh they're trying alright...but we have conflict with the consultant they've hired
I'll fill you in another time
I faxed the amendments to Houston and San Francisco
See your email re contract/DA fix
Mike Day and I talked
In short doesn't seem to be any real downside in raising it and seeing how PG&E responds
If this doesn't answer the question sufficiently let me know
If you have any alternative suggestions questions and/or comments please let me know

I'll call you in a bit
Sorry to take so long to get this to you but here is the info you asked for yesterday

Hope that you're not getting beat up by your bomb-throwing colleagues
Sue saw your notes but didn't try to incorporate
Pulled it together quickly
And hope it helps
I spoke with Ken Smith about his work with Enron
If a project arises that will consume more time he will contact me
I think that's how things currently stand
He said he might get back to me
If he calls back I'll let you know

I've met Craver but don't know him as well as Fielder
I understand that you guys were dealing with John Fielder
For sure we want to know what they are up to
Do you know the CFO
The extra costs would damage businesses and family budgets she said
You have to catch him by the pool
But that's not their only contribution
Both sides say they had compelling legal arguments
So why did the PUC after maintaining publicly for months that it would prevail chose to settle
But he and others said there was another looming fear
We don't think they can get away with it but we're not entirely sure
But now the utility said it prefers its bankruptcy reorganization plan
The case is long closed and our suggestion was not accepted
Therefore we don't have to worry about it
Steve I haven't opened these but let me know if this is the stuff
I'll have folks get those and forward them
Be back to you soon
I don't believe these are what I am looking for
I think that we should pursue both

It was great having both of you there
I think every one had a very good time
John Wayne at his spookiest
As I have said before I can take mom and dad only in small doses
They fight too much for me

The amendments make the bill revenue neutral among other things which makes it a simple majority vote bill
This work for you

I see no issues
I am also forwarding to Jim Steffes for comments
You may want to check in with her
Ask me about it next time I see you

Hi Betty - Hope this little note finds you doing well
Didn't we have a wonderful time of fellowship last night.
Claudette had such a fresh anointing on her
Listen I have your email adress but not your phone #
I told you to download that stuff and view it later
That is the only gibberish that you should be receiving
Indeed it is a good morning waking up and finding you there

Girl get your butt back in the house and don't come again
I will be out today
I send Marnie an email too
I am in pain
I need to ask a quick question
Remember I don't have a lot of grades at this point so any zeros really bring down their grades
Once she turns in her work it will com up
Just checking with you to see how Candis' day was today
Thanks for keeping me informed
Oh God Carolyn Your words have brought tears to my eyes and an ache in my heart
I'm just trying to get my house in order
I love you like my sister and don't forget that
You haven't called me about helping you with the house
Just wanted to say that I really miss you
Although I know that we are still friends you have been so much more
I have grown spiritually because of your teaching
I REALLY MISS YOU
What is your friends name again that goes there
Here is my P.O
GOD BLESS I MISS YOU GUYS
Hi Dana Please let me know if you see any Linder money come in the next few days
Thanks so much for the E postcards that you sent me
I guess you have talked to Monte
Email me back so we can talk
Oh I need your physical address so I can send you something
What time is your conference time
I did not assign her a consequence
You can send it interoffice if you like
OK Pat how fast do you need it
Pat We are just depositing it today
Sorry I got the check during my budget blitz and forgot to tell you
Have you seen a check from Hanson this month
If so can I get a copy
I am the person handling this opening
I have sent your resume to the hiring manager
I will relate any updates to you
Bobbie I am no longer in Portfolio Reporting
Yes I have thought about being an Admin
I just don't see any entry level administrative positions out there
Why did you think about me when you heard Shackles
Do you have any of their cd's
I love their music
Have you heard of Mary Mary
I listen to both
Hopefully we will hear that the correction has been made in the next day or two
Do either of you want in on the steaks
If we do it should I get one or two packages
Wow I almost forgot
I will contact her soon
I hope you didn't think that I forgot
I spoke to Amy and she would love to meet you
You probably want to know a little about me
Of course I would be interested in hearing something about you as well
Let me know what you think and we can go from there
What the hell have you been up to
I just got your email address from Carl
I got married last July
Anyway are you still in Portland
That's right you just won our Weekly ROULETTE RUN contest
Thank you and again congratulations
Wish you a great day
I hope you got my info out to Oliver
I'd like to hear from him
I think I'm going to do it
Why aren't you staying at your parent's house
Call me anytime
I pointed out the two wheels that could be purchased real time but this is not there obligation
I'll call you after the holidays
I'd like to know which company and what your doing
I'm staying at Brett's this weekend...even though he is Maryland
Yeah I'm alive and still w/Enron...but oh the details...I'll call you soon
Olliver contacted me the other day to say hello and update etc
I'll write you again from home
As we all know that'll be very slow and coming
Carl and I are doing great here...house is good dogs are good and pregancy is going just fine
If you have any comments or suggestions please e-mail Jon at numbers@numbersintoknowledge.com and copy me as well
For your convenience I have included questions from other course evaluations to help guide your thoughts
I will be distributing some pre-course reading material
Course Outline Put facts at your fingertips Key references and data sources
You can redeem FREE prizes with your points
If you have any questions about this position please see Bill at the Real Time Desk
Are you married yet
Amy Thank you for my birthday card
I really appreciate it
I'm sorry but I've been meaning to call you
I just haven't been able to make the time
I was in Austin this past weekend for the UT football game and I stayed with Bryan and Monica
We went out on the lake on Sunday and I went skiing
Jennifer I enjoyed meeting you last week
Too bad we didn't get to meet up the second night
I definitely had a good time
Did you go out again on Wednesday
I tried to call you at your hotel but I guess I missed you
I promised I looked for you that night
Did you go to the APB party at Grasshopper
So that probably means you have a three day weekend and are back on for days Monday
That's just my guess
You need to call me when you get back on days
Are you planning any more trips back to Houston
Nice to hear from you
I doubt I can find it up here but it's worth a try
Mike We need to know the volumes of their load and how it is broken down
We would also need to know their load forecast
Obviously if this is limited we would want to value it accordingly
Obviously I don't know you very well so I wanted to make sure you knew that
I would enjoy seeing you again but its up to you
What's up with your schedule
At least the rumors have stopped and now we know what will become of Enron
As far as my job at least I work in the power side
I'm also glad that it is a Houston co that bought us
I can't imagine the rumors that are going on there
I am ready for my two weeks off
It's crazy out there but I have to get home to Texas
I looked good
I was a sheriff
If you can't find that CD up there you can always pick it up back in Texas
I'm going to Dallas for Thanksgiving and I'm just glad I don't have to fly
I can't imagine what the lines will be like that week
I'm off work this Friday so if you get a chance to call better make it Thursday
How was your Halloween party
Did you dress up
I hung out with some friends but no costumes
Dexter Freebish - that's it
I'll have to look for it up here
I cannot wait
What are your plans for Thanksgiving
I apologize for taking so long to respond to your message
Needless to say they sent me home to get better
I secretly think everyone was happy not to hear me talk
As I am getting off night shift today I will be unable to attend the HR presentation
In case you didn't receive this from the night crew
Rob please give me call on this one
As I had mentioned this is a competitive process and time is of the essence
Wes can you adjust West Power numbers for the drop in headcount
Kay can you please try to organize ASAP
I will get to the point
Please remember no feedback can be completed on BECK,SALLY W until you have approved the list
I have taken a few minutes to write my idea because verbal ideas can get lost in the shuffle
Jim can you send me hard copies - I am having trouble opening these reports
I'll keep you posted if anything begins to move
Ken I think we should pass on the sponsorship of this event
If you have a different view lets discuss at your earliest convenience
Could you please explain
You will have your day in court to discuss margin soon
Perhaps it was a typo
Dan any help would be appreciated - we are very well positioned in the Florida market at this point
Ike sorry for the delay it took us longer to deal with certain issues than expected
I have faxed you a proposal
Lets discuss at your earliest convenience
Guys I would like you to consider the following people to provide the basis of your producer marketing team
As well please ensure that both Kevin and I sign off on the filing before it goes out
Neither Nancy P or our paralegal Jan saw this notice
I found it after the intervention date
Please remember no feedback can be completed on VIRGO,ROBERT until you have approved the list
Dorie as per our discussion
Please remember no feedback can be completed on MAYS,WAYNE E until you have approved the list
I look forward to great success in the next yea= r
Kay can you handle this stuff for me
I attach an executive summary that gives further details
If you have any questions please call myself Paul or Eric
Mark fyi and between you and I
Further it helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue
In short I would like to keep the reporting structures the same
Even when it is more times than not it is perfunctory in nature
Second it is sub-optimal
Many of these conversations revolve around my first point
And just yesterday I had a very unsatisfactory phone call with Mark Haedicke regarding Peter Keohane
Third it is costly
I would appreciate your thoughts on this
Jane we would like to go the Adjustment of Status route
Great job - we all appreciate your management of the situation
The A&A program is our most important asset
Great job guys - keep it coming
I hope this rationale will manage your issues
I think radical change is not the answer
I think this is inappropriate and will speak to Jeff
Just thought you should know
When you talk to them get their feedback on Super Saturday and the whole process
I assume that you and your team will implement
Like we spoke about I do not see a need to widely distribute this through the commercial organization
I would just implement
Chris Rob Milnthorp will give you a call to further discuss the opportunity
I need more information to feel comfortable making this decision
Please communicate to your organization as appropriate
I could not find them on e-mail
It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline
Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter
Do you want to meet on these
This is a very important function - please represent us well
Steve great letter and arguement I think the more public we can be on this one the better
We plan to talk to the press about it as well
In particular we would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning
Chris e-mail didn't pick up your name
Fran can you speak to Brian on this issue
Please give me your thoughts
As far as the weekend lets just play it by ear
Let me know what I need to do otherwise
I thought this Itinerary might be easier to read
If you could send me the phone number to the Rio de Janeiro office I would greatly appreciate it
Also Dave wanted to know if you could arrange transportation for them
Jim what ever you think is appropriate
D'Arcy sorry I missed you last week
Maybe we can have a discussion then
I would very much like to get your opinion
Thank you in advance for any effort extended in my behalf
Please advise that you are in agreement and we will book asap
Could you shed some light on this for me
What are you looking for
Perhaps we can discuss while you are here
Unfortunately we have a tight deadline because Delainey is looking for this information by the end of the week
Also if you could let me know today about the expense breakout I can start working on that now
Tim don't worry about me - it worked out fine
Guys I spoke with Mark this morning
Phillip/Barry go ahead and start working with Mark as you develop your plans going forward
Jim I would start focusing some attention on gas at this point
Maybe not all his fault...I do not have enough data
I think this is sound and worth looking at
But I think this should be looked at by those groups
They set their priorities
If they want to pay for him being down there we can house him and coordinate etc
Probably narrow minded but hopefully pragmatic on my part
I used him last to interface with Networks
So is he worth keeping for Enron
I say yes in the right role
I say no and have told him as much
Call if you need more
Thank you for any efforts extended in my behalf
Barry I have not spoken to Whitt yet - working on this week
I would start thinking about how to get that done
I would call Oxley for help if needed
How did your conversations go with the Denver Office
This number will be in the P/L under your name
Are you in agreement
Guys if you or any of you people have interest in attending please contact Wendy Roy
Just to inform you of my thoughts if they are applicable
If there are new investments please add them to the template with appropriate comment
Jim hold off until I let you know to go
As a significant contributor to the PAC and Enron's other adventures I don't have the room
Personally I also have difficulty making campaign contributions so closely linked to specific legislation or policy
Attached is a recent plea from our lobbying firm in Nashville
Barbara we are getting tremendous pressure for contributions in these last days before the election
As I have mentioned to you Enron has been referred to specifically by one of the most powerful Senators
Chris I would let this fish go
You should have made the call to kill it
Can you answer Marty's other questions
I wasn't exactly sure what you were asking for
If it was my opinion that is above
If it is some other just let me know
Let me know if you need any further information
Guys Joe Sutton had passed down an opportunity that probably fits your capabilities better than ours
As far as the turbines I would probably exit them in the most opportune manner
If you cannot attend please contact Dave directly
Guys what is your plan
Could you please provide me your plan with these units
However I want to keep a strong presence in both markets and understand the language political and cultural issues
If I am incorrect Janet let me know
Guys I would like your opinion on this potential transaction
Dick I have signed the DASH
Please keep an eye on this for me
John I don't get it - are they trading gas and power
Also we will be forming a cross-commodity trading group=
Please join us in congratulating everyone on their new positions
Tim please provide Jana with your choice of person ASAP
Joe do you have a home for this guy - he desperately wants to stay in S America
Can we have one slot
If you have any questions please feel free to call me
Or do we want this turbine
If we win the bid we enter into PPA negotiations that could take about six months to finish
Until the PPA is signed we wouldn't know for certain that we had clinched the deal
Ownership of this turbine would marginally strengthen our prospects
Conversely if our deal firms up before Delaney has a firm use I would want to take the turbine
Do we want a more structured process
Thank you for your support of the Associate and Analyst Programs
I vote not to do the deal otherwise
As you recall we worked very intensively in trying to support an IPO which would take out the debt
Janet I'm not picking on you - I just can't believe legal and corporate let this go through
By the way Redmond will take responsibility for the Pan Nat arbitration as per our discussion
I'll leave it as is...no problem
Chris do you have a deal book -explaining the overall transaction returns and risk
This will help me facilitate the process
I am available to talk about it at your convenience
How does this sound to you
Janet I completely disagree with legals position
I believe this is a significant control issue
Guys attached you will find a list of key transactions identified in the Hot List for each business unit
They should in turn encourage their direct reports to participate
Jeff hopefully we can convince you to come when we re-schedule - seemed like an easy call
Janet he can approve but can't sign as a director
Please give me a call at your earliest convenience
Ike given our schedules it appears that e-mail may be the most effective communication tool
Jeff can you speak briefly with Kevin on this one - intriguing idea if the execution was probable
By the way what is our plan with Sithe
Rick which meeting are you refering to
Are we not circumventing the spirit of the political contribution rules
Please feel free to call me to discuss further
I will be in the office on Monday
Bill Gif and Robert have a very good relationship and rely on him for assistance for their clients regularly
I prefer the original idea at Enron Field
Kevin how do we get at the transmission without buying the entire company
My e-mail is not working for them
As far as specifics you will have to wait and see
What do you mean by this
Chris you are officially the king today
Lot of moving parts - I will keep you posted
Oz David is interested in the fuel cell business do you need his skill set
I learned a lot
Right now I am working for Enron Corp Environmental Health and Safety
I graduated from Michigan Technological University with a B.S
I have worked in manufacturing and the oil field service business
I have worked at the corporate level in both businesses
I know that I can help Enron in this area
If you would like my resume please let me know
I will route them back to Ken Jeff and Joe for final approval then post the answers in eMeet
I don't have any insight into this question you may want to direct it to Dave Delainey
As I am the Treasurer my focus is on financial activities of the company
Would you please respond
I will route to Ken Jeff and Joe for approval and then post the response in eMeet
Unfortunately I gave you the wrong date
With respect to the straw man I have worked on it but it is not complete
I am trying to work with her recruiters who are in the middle of campus presentations etc
I will call Kay and get on your schedule
Ultimately I would like to continue to push this with the leadership team
Guys can you forward your parts
On a serious note you are doing the right thing for the company and for Barry's career
As you are aware I will aggressively support you and the Toronto iniative
Are we taking disposal or terminal value risk on the facility
Is this a play that you would support
How is it going otherwise
I am glad someone found the right formula
Can you direct me to the right person
I am not advocating this play just passing on the message
If ESCA gets Davis and Ridge I think that we would have a good opportunity for you
Once I have more information I'll be in contact
Right now they have Pacificorp and are trying to get someone from government in PA and CA
Do you have any interest in presenting
David you may be getting to the nub here
Guys what are we going to do with this contract and the barges
Jeff/Dick/Ray what are your opinions
Guys can you give me an update on what this deal is about - e-mail would be fine
I look forward to sitting down to discuss
I also met with Greg Wolfe
Upon agreement on the metrics I would like issue these reports on a monthly basis
The deals I can think of are Kaiser Roseville Santa Clara Redding and Merced
I will provide you with a weekly update on the status
John I think you may want to be part of this
Paul I had a look at the pitch and I thought it was an intriguing idea
Obviously these are very cursory remarks - I have not spent a great deal of time on this
In other works we have no intention of lifting their offer
Finally we are not ordering HRSG's or steam turbines
These guys add no value and they are killing me
As far as EECC involvement as I had mentioned Coleman was a part of all these discussions
Obviously I was unsuccessful in explaining such a sophisticated strategy
Guys I have explained the strategy/tactics that have lead to this position in some detail
Krista you are very welcome - best of luck in the future
Ok - you got the ball
Have you looked at this
Kay can you set up a dinner with Randall
On a separate note I would like to take you up on your offer of your time and resources
Thanks for your help look forward to talking to you soon
I am in the office over the next several days
Christi I was unable to open the file can you please send a hard copy
Let me know if you would like the list
I also sent you a hard copy on Friday
I believe the timing on this is rather short
Please get back to me at your earliest convenience
Given that the warranty expires in less than twelve months what value do we really get
I spoke with Frank Gardner the acting President of the mine
We will keep you posted if anything materializes
Just so you'll know attached is a sample Term Sheet that I have previously showed MRI
Randall I appreciate the invite - I would like to continue to be involved
It was a pleasure to meet you and your team
My time and resources are at your disposal
This may incent the holdouts to agree to our needs
If you need any additional information please let me know
Guys I appreciate the quality work and deal flow that you are generating
I think things went really well and I would be happy to provide you with more detail if needed
Don NewPort Generation has called me interested in the plants
I will try to call you later today but will send this note just in case I miss you
So we would like to talk about tolling etc
Otherwise I leave it in your capable hands to get together
We have prototypes under development and the costs for our technology compare favorably to the existing market
The brochure will elaborate on the advantages of our technology
As a result of our first discussion I understand that Enron might not be interested in new generation technology
I wanted to provide you with additional information on BLP
If you know other companies interested in investing or joint developing a new generation technology please let me know
Thank you for taking the time to review our materials
Which would be best for you
If this date is not amenable to you please let me know when you would be available
As we discussed today I am sending you this preliminary list of the Calme employees
David I believe this should have been addressed to you
Please advise if it should be forwarded elsewhere
Tom I appreciate the e-mail - sorry for the delay in response
I am on-side with all your points
I did not expect to have such an audience
I am very open to the additional warrant option
This will ease our pain level on schedule
Tammy are you getting all these reports
Jen I would be pleased to attend - sorry for the delay on the e-mail
David how are we making out with this item
Let me know if you think any of these are inappropriate
Carol I believe Hunter is leading the charge on building the gas fundamentals group
I think that she could be a valuable addition to Enron
Can you tell me to whom I should forward this
I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you on Friday
As you can see I would like to find a position which will utilize my strong operations background
I am open to any avenues you suggest
Additionally I am interested in expanding my circle of acquaintances
It seems that you may possibly be able to provide me with a few select introductions
The more contacts I make the more opportunities I can uncover
If you have any thoughts or ideas please jot them down
Kay can you please set up a time at Janelle's convenience
As per our discussion
Kay can you set up a one hour to half an hour with each if possible
It sounded like he was thinking about Friday
I will discuss with you when I have more details
How do we get control of the thing
Ben Thought you might be interested in this
I think you agree
By the same token if they said 'free' up front we don't have to pay
What are your thought on this
Congrats on your deals
Also bringing one of your current AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion
Let me know if this isn't what you needed
Given that we could benefit most from the successful application of this venture it is worth the initial work
Hey you guys are copying my model
Please join us in congratulating these individuals
My understanding is that we are all staying at the Mirage
John called me yesterday and he wants to Golf Fri Sat Sun
When and how often do you want to golf
Milly and I are up for playing every day
I am thinking Friday afternoon
The Desert Inn is closed while we are there
I will take your lead on this one
Guys can you come explain some of this to me including where we stand on the GE issues
I will be in my office later this morning
Please keep information concerning our transaction Highly confidential
I have passed this on to Lavorato
He suggested that we continue to work through Fred
It was fun while it lasted
Not your fault/problem but a real issue for me
I am committed to pushing hard to get this deal done
In all or almost all cases we have accepted your position
I hope this is not the case
I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse
FYI I got this from Dick
Just want to confirm that it's consistent with your recollection
Tammy are you getting copies of all these reports for the book
Rebecca looks fine to me
I may take you up on this next season
Regardless I appreciate all the good work you and your team are doing
If Max or Virgo are not happy I am not happy
I make money you make money
I am correct
Sorry I sounded negative but I was voicing Tim's concern as well
Note to Dave I suggest that Steve Bob and I take this up with Dick before involving you
I look forward to our discussion in Portland next week
I would much appreciate your assistance
Do you anticipate any others
Mike lets discuss just after Wayne and I get together to discuss the technical book or in conjunction
Chris where are we on gas interconnect
If you feel that is necessary just let me know
I will look foward to seeing you there
Ben can you spend a little time and give me some feedback on this item
Look fwd to supporting your effort as needed
In addition if there is other information that would be useful let us know
If you are available we would appreciate you attending
So sorry I left you name off
Please make a note on your calendars
I will forward the location ASAP
Mark I am in favour
Let me know your thoughts on the proposed changes
Should we also include Tammy Sheppard
Guys this is my first cut on who I would want to be in this group
Look forward to your comments
Either way they will be a strong bid for assets given their story to Wall Street
Ideally it would be someone at the Director level
Please mark your calendars for this meeting
If you can't be there maybe we can backbrief you
I have a very good relationship with Dan Leff and Sunde
Because of a scheduling conflict earlier in the month we had to cancel our original plans for dinner
Dave can we discuss this matter
Rob I spoke with Paul
Please let me know at your convenience
Whatever you can get you can keep and reduce the fee
You could make this easy for both of us
I propose to do this
How does it change my status as a non-immigrant resident
However they did suggest that you might like to consider a Permanent Residency application for a Multi-national Executive
If you would like to pursue this avenue please let me know and we can proceed
When Matt has the site location set up I will notify you
I have checked his settings and everything seems to be fine
Could you please take a look at his mail file
Please reply this back to Kay Chapman and myself
Although I would agree that ECC should lead the sale process
Ultimately I have not seen any outsourcing transactions from Canada in the deal structuring/due diligence queue
This is not what we agreed to in Columbia Lakes
Unlike the U.S. Ontario is a relatively small market where we can and have complete coverage
I have attached for your reference a status report on industrial coverage
As you know there exists a continuum from portfolio management through to the energy island concept
I cant imagine how a U.S originator could talk to or offer these services to Canadian Industrials
As for Tembec I am confused with what you mean by not changing the deal team
I would suggest a conference call next week
I thought this had been agreed to already
Let me describe what I understand of the facts
I like this guy
Thanks for taking time to have dinner with us last night
No basis in fact here but I suspect there are too many contractor/owner games going on
Do you want me to shake it loose do you want to work it with Leff or bad idea
Let me know if you have any additional questions
Have asked Rick several times about her future with his group
I am thinking the presenters are Laine Rick Jose
Can we send the page per topic around by this friday
Let me know your thoughts after you speak with him
Do you have any preliminary ideas
On another note last night was a great idea and I think it went a long way
If you have any questions/conflicts please feel to call me
Kay please have Jordan forward this in hard copy to your attention
Our group has tended to work this way but I am willing to add more detail as you suggested
Congratulations on your appointment to CEO - what's next
I am working with Bryan and Ray on the transition everything seems to be going along smoothly
I expect to move next week
I should have more feedback by the end of the week
Thank you for your support on my move to EBS
I look forward to working with you again
Wes I believe that we don't have any issues recognizing the value from this transaction - please confirm
I feel confident that this transaction will be closed in September
Jennifer you are very welcome and I look forward to continuing to work with you - all the best
Rebecca if you wouldn't mind I would like to sit in on the Monday meeting
Below is a note that I received this morning from Pete
Currently he is headed for wholesale merchant
Let me know if the above format is ok
How do you want to deliver his service award
Please note that this is a change from your original scheduling
Mark note the feedback from the AA's it is imperative that we get a handle on this
Let me know when I can spring our plan on Jeff
After listening to the comments my conclusion is that there are some problems that need to be addressed
Let me know about the next meeting to discuss
Thank you for meeting with me yesterday and discussing the Construction Exchange product concept
Thanks again for your time
Mike if you Janet or Dave can cut the deal with Izzo go ahead and speak to him
Who if anyone would you like us to pass this along to
Give me a call if you need more information
Over the years it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers
I vote to kill it
I only want Lou going up if Tom is involved
However Mark Muller is up to go and I have spoken to him with regard to the opportunity today
He is expecting your call
I would appreciate you coordinating that meeting
I probably need to get back to him either way shortly
I think we have all spent enough time on this effort
On a side issue are you aware that this is a JEDI I property
At what price will your unit pay to liquidate the fund
Let me know where you end up
Jordan I assume the memo I asked for is in hard copy on my desk
We think it does but we are not sure that there will be a material improvement
We have passed that question on to our outside tax counsel and will let you know his view
Guys lets set up a meeting between the three of us on Monday ASAP to discuss
As I mentioned in my voicemail last night I spoke with Randy and Aldo
The tone was positive and they said Goldman was very bullish on the whole story
I have tried to convince these guys that while Trading is people it is also philosophy style and approach
Sorry to bog down your vacation with this
If you want to talk today I will be around
I believe this e-mail was intended for Susan Scott of ENA
Unless asked just bring your smile
I spoke with Smutney this evening
That's it from our end
Don go ahead and set it up - what have been discussing with them on the gas side
They would like to look at our peakers to supplement strategy
More interestingly Forster went into his desire to talk with you about other ideas relating to T&M
He wants CSFB and us to co-ordinate meeting schedule
Apparently we are talking with these guys on the gas side
I would get Calger on side as well
I believe we can get to a trade with them
Rodney interesting title- is someone giving you grief on this strategy
Rob please follow up with Dorie she will handle the process for you
Please let me know your thoughts on this
Westinghouse has the repair lead and so far is giving it the right level of attention
Jeff I am not aware of any questions
Feel free to call me with any questions
We are setting up the remainder as we speak
Once we have a few ideas I would like to pitch Whalley Sherriff and Mark when I get back
I believe this is waht you asked for
Say the word and we will get cracking
Rob I have not heard what the plan of action is with Moore
Guys where is Rebox - it seems to have disappeared
No way they can do it at these prices
If gas is cheap and plentiful utilities will have a harder time investing in coal technology he said
Janet we have been down the road with these guys before and it was not very pleasant
If enron exceeds the range they are bound to sell it to Houston P&P group
With regards to tax mitigation I will have a better idea by the end of this week
I would speak to Sherriff on that one
Have we looked at this
Let me know if you think we need to work EME
If you and Steve can come up with a better indication of value I will support that transaction
Rick looks like a good start - as per our discussion this is a very important issue
Thank you in advance for your promt attention to this matter

I am extremely apologetic for any inconvenience this may have caused
Guys we need to figure this out in the next couple weeks
John do you want to take a stab based on manager director and VP rankings
I made the decision to not accept the offer
At the same time I now realize that I made a stupid mistake in turning down the Enron offer
If you are willing to reconsider I would love to talk to you
Considering what I put you through the last time if you do not want to reconsider I can understand
David I would appreciate it I can meet with you in person to discuss this further with you
If you are okay with it can I buy you lunch and talk about this
On the fee let Mike manage he knows my thoughts
Let me see the final before release

Janet scheduling this is a nightmare - if Ben can't make it you can cover
Laura I would like to congratulate you and your group on a very successful quarter
Please forward to your organization as appropriate
I would like to manage this under Dave and your leadership
Thanks for your time and patience today
Thanks for offering me the shot to capitalize on it
It looks like we hit a home run
Let me know what you want me to do
As I understand there is no real cohesive plan or course of action
John should I get in touch with Phillippe or do anything else
Jeff what exactly do you want Craig going to be doing
Then I will speak with Max if appropriate
Is Max with us

Please mark your calendar
Guys there is quite a number of us dealing with this problem - what are our solutions
Since you will be in charge will this flight time work
Jim I am also curious where you are in your thoughts and plans given your new role
ISOs and RTOs should only worry about transmission not the price of the commodity they are transmitting
It can wait until you have it all completed
Do my proposed coverage standards and reporting format meet your expectations
I believe that FPLe has just recently expanded/updated their system
I would like to try to learn more about their system
I think we can make money off of all three options
Let me know if you wish to discuss
Again I am sorry for the confusion and I hope this helps
If you have any question please feel free to call me
Greg it is really up to you - if you have other things to do don't worry about it
However if you think you have it handled that is OK for me as well
That is why Kay asked you about it today
Otherwise we would be glad to speak to him in the future if we decide to sell tha asset
I hope this meets with your approval
Sounds promising - keep it moving
The meetings were productive and we are making progress
We walked them through our peaker valuation as well
I raised this incremental value issue with them
I called Westfahl as you suggested but he never responded
Reflecting on our conversation at lunch the other day I want to re-emphasize my concerns about the schedule issues
But I think that this is real world
How does this change our view on Moore
Unfortunately we have experienced a bit of a set-back re Ontario market opening
Bob I know that you made this work
I don't think we need to distribute this data farther
If you have questions please give me a call

Regards Delainey I try to run clean conservative books

This is not my problem
I should not receive this expense
I will follow up shortly
Guys I will forward the info as it becomes available
We can get together to discuss if you like
As requested I have collect the following information for your review
Our records indicate that we are missing social security numbers for Dawna Jean Samantha Jean and Kassandra Dawn
Would you please respond with this info
In this capacity I would like that engineer to report to you or Wayne Mays
Jeff what is your current thought process on TXU
Since TXU is in such a world of hurt do we have anyone looking at their business/assets
Guys I am getting the impression that we are having quality control issues - it just sounds sloppy
Am I wrong
Do we need more focused resources
We wish both Jeff and Bryan well in their expanded roles
I still have not received any cost reports from Nepco
Where did he rank against other folks at the super saturday
If you carry out your threat to abandon the assets this will result in invalidation of our insurance coverage
I hope you understand that this is not in anyone's interest
I think Jean is gong to be there - thats ok
If you have any questions/conflicts regarding the above mentioned meeting please feel free to call me

Sometimes in addition to supplying New Equipment we can supply used refurbished or surplus assets

Is there areas where we could be more aggressive or proactive
Don with regard to your previous message please contact Michael
Let me know if this is your thoughts as well
Please reply with your direct supervisors name
I was located in India at the time and project Summer was on at the time
I had then taken an assignment to work in India and have been there for some years now
My guess is they won't
We actually think that their project is blocked
I believe that Calpine would undertake the permitting and interconnection work at their cost and risk if needed
I believe this is the right call
Mark you have this one
Chris is definitely a loss to our team
Please advise as to his qualified replacement on these specific deals
Until you tell me otherwise we are going full steam ahead
Mike can we put the screws to ABB given the significant transformer business we forwarded their way

I would like see us make this work

Please fill him in on your discussions to date

Should you wish to discuss the matter further please do not hesitate to contact me
I am still puzzled by this

I had another good week at pulp and paper
Now is the time for you to stand and be counted
It is later than you think
Here are their tips
First they accept each moment as a gift to be received with joy
Second they use each moment to maximum advantage
Third they are bent on making a contribution to humanity
Fourth they learn from their mistakes
Fifth they concentrate on the task at hand
Sixth they plan for the future rather than fretting over the past
This looks good Mike - I appreciate the efforts
I appreciate the effort on the peakers
Rob does the new contract have the same price or is it an increase
Generally it has been my understanding that each commercial group pays for such marketing expenses from its own budget
I will also coordinate the execution of all documents regarding legal liability renewal rights etc

Did you or Jeff speak with Jim

I am copying the lawyers in my group for their information
Thank you for your note
I enclose a clean copy of my memo as requested
In the meantime if there is anything I can assist with please give me a call
Rex I will ask him to include you on the list
Rob thank you for the information
You opinion might be asked as well so I wanted to provide this to you
We do not ask the judges for their political affiliations
We provide them with the tools to be more effective
Second a generic description of Chapman from their P.R
Also I wanted to mention to you a significant connection between Chapman University and Enron
I will be Dean of the George L Argyros School of Business and Economics
Do you have any suggestions about how to proceed
Andy I would appreciate your including Rex Rogers on the distribution list for the Litigation Report
Here's the latest according to me
In the normal course I do not expect it will reach hearing on Monday
I hope this clarifies the position here
Emily it appears that a matter in Europe will prevent me from attending
I will contact you if the plans change
I look forward to seeing all of you in Philadelphia
I would like to make him an offer if you are agreeable
Mark thank you for the message
Should you have any questions please contact me at your convenience
I look forward to learning more about the Enron Legal Department
To say it has been positive is an understatement
However when you work with Enron the opposite is true
When there is a problem to solve it is everyone's problem
They keep questioning until they understand
Nobody minds repeating themselves
As you well know yours is not a simple business
As you know in any litigation is critical that the court view your side as the teller of truth
You increase your chances of winning
The outside lawyers like me feel they are part of the team
Outside lawyers do not feel as if they are on trial
Thanks for letting us come along for the ride
Bill I have just returned from almost two weeks in London and seen your message
I believe our respective organizations make a great team
Also I mentioned to Jonathon Sumption Q.C
I will coordinate travel plans with Bobby
I think it would be very interesting to hear from Dr Brenner
Consequently I have tentatively arranged for Malcolm K Brenner to join us that day
He recently made a similar presentation to our Board of Trustees and it was very well received
If anyone thinks it undesirable to depart from past practice in this way please say so
Please let me know if you have interest
Jim I promised you some contact details
Please let me know what Michelle finds out
Are you in the loop on this
FYI I'm trying to get my hand on the report
In light of your admirable batting average we may need to reinsert you in the CATS Litigation
As directors of Atlantic Water Trust Arthur Andersen will request you to sign the AWT management representation letter
As to yoga I do intend to try it as soon as my travel schedule permits
Have you tried the yoga in the Body Shop yet
I was thinking of doing likewise= with EES Canada
I am however sensitive to Jim's concerns,= and therefore wanted your thoughts on the matter
Thought you should see this
I would like you to carefully study this proposal without bias since it would be relevant in our lives
However I am doing this because of the nature of my job
I have children to cater for even when I retire as the director which is just next year
So I need something tangible to fall back on when I retire
Should your response be positive I would then instruct on the next step to take
We demand a quick response from you
Irrespective of what happens we count on your maturity to keep the transaction to yourself
So you are advised to treat this transaction with utmost confidentiality
Looking forward to your urgent response
Saudi I thought you would be interested in this
RW I agree
I think this is the final list
I have not heard anything more about that
Do you want lunch served in the room or should we break for lunch
Should either your assistant or Stephanie Harris be included

Please share with interested individuals within your groups
If they agree I think your approach in completing this is appropriate
Ed Let me know a.s.a.p
I think the figures are correct
I fully support settling the claim as you have outlined
FYR These look fine to me
Lisa I would appreciate your asking the appropriate attorney to focus on this
It looks fine to me
Obviously it would be better if it were more definitive
I'll send it to V&E
I agree with Ed proposal to accept the settlement

Rich I very much appreciate your message--thank you
FYR I believe that the Resolutions No
Again thanks for your help and my apologies for bothering you about this
Regards Chuck At this time we have not received notice of payment
I'd hate to be wasting your time
Also can we assume that this covers issues at foreign subsidiaries
If the indemnity responds the company seeks reimbursement from the policy up to its limit
I don't have this information
Folks I need the policy that covers US subsidiaries and foreign subsidiaries ASAP

Paula tells me that we have accepted AF's resignation letter

Bill I want to thank you and your team for everthing you are doing to assist our cause
I am confident that together we shall ultimately prevail
Please let us know if Houston meets your approval
Mark My apologies as I thought I had previously responded
We have filed replies to their opposition papers
The plaintiffs make this argument in simple terms and when argued as such it has some appeal
Lastly we finally received a response from the plaintiffs to the settlement proposal we made in June
Should you have any questions about this case or should you need any further information please call me
Please format and print the attachment on my personal letterhead
Please reply that I will not be able to attend
Eric thank you
If so we should add wind energy to the construction and development and information dissemination sections of the recitation
I believe with these changes our activities would be fairly disclosed
Today I have checked with the remainder of the DC office and no one has had such a conversation
Thus I am seeking new opportunities at the Deputy/Associate General Counsel level

I look forward to seeing you this year
I look forward to seeing you one day
Just remember you're smarter and better then the rest of them
Haedicke knows we expect a meeting today or tomorrow with a preference for sooner
The items he suggested are on the agenda
I will wait to hear form you or Steph
I have the new one
Otherwise we will modify order at the meeting
Others have asked for a report of my experience
I am alive and sore
If you are not interested in the report please delete this email
Remember that you are helping colleagues and others and perhaps yourself with your contributions
I did either ride my bike or push it up several hills for approx
I am extremely pleased to have participated in the event
I was wrong
I laughed out loud when I saw the meal being served and wondered whether the historical connection was intentional
I came up with what I thought was the perfect solution
Before the race started I looked for the largest biker I could spot
Then the unexpected happened -my large person biker turned on her afterburners and left me in the dust
So I made a pledge to myself
No matter what I was not going to overexert myself
As I thought back I remembered being passed by many bikers
I stopped at a pay phone booth in a small town and called home
But I wanted to go as far as I could
I decided it was time to take a rest--a temporary not a permanent one
The local chiggars and I bonded almost immediately
I finally decided to leave and found that the rest had given me new strength
I thought I might be able to ride again
Needless to say I was happy with my plan to get as much sleep as possible
I badly needed the rest
I was not amused
Also I did get a taste of ole country Texas along the way
I was exhausted and not amused
At that point in time I looked like I just stepped out of a sweat shower
I have talked to him
Mark would you please furnish me the name of the William Cutler attorney that you are dealing with
I also believe this was sent to me in error
I believe this was also sent to me in error
I believe this e-mail was sent to me in error
If you have questions please let me know
Thanks for your help and patience
I assume you and Sharon will take it from here
Gail your proposal is fine by me
That is why I bought
I saw an opportunity for energy companies overall with regards to sales volume & earnings potential
Thanks for your support and guidance on the AFS memorial
Aft= er your review we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss
If you co= ncur with the actions suggested please advise
Second it= must be able to post margin to its clients
Obviously it is a bit premature to finalize the plan so this presentation just reviews different scenarios
Jano thank you so much
I love you too now and always
All my best to Bob Corby Holly and Tanner
John I truly appreciate your message and your support
I will attend
I'd like your permission to retain and put some of our PRI policy questions to Mr Gaisman
The clear choice in all of our minds is Jonathan Gaisman
He is straightforward inquisitive prepared thoughtful and interested in working on this with us
In addition he seemed familiar with the option to sue clause in many policies
I would rank him a strong second choice
I would propose that we issue Gaisman instructions tomorrow or Monday
If you agree let me know and I will take care of it
Rob thank you very much for your message
We may well have need to call on your able assistance
Steve thank you for the message
That was I believe just the day before all hell broke loose at Enron
In case it is needed another copy of my resume is attached
This is the individual you had expressed an interest in meeting
My thoughts and prayers are with you
God is with us

Per our conversation attached is a revised draft Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement between enovate and Oxy for your comment
I am not sure if Jeff Hodge has already volunteered me
If he has not I would like to volunteer to be on the drafting committee
Otherwise I can make myself available whenever the drafting committee meets
I am working on getting the Bowie contract
Meanwhile I spoke to the B & J attorney
I am fine with the changes
Please do not forward this to them

Please review and call me if I have missed anything
I will send Mike Palmer the Transaction Agreements this afternoon
Do you know which attorney initialed it
I can get a copy from him
I'd attach a copy but it hasn't been scanned yet
Because it covers swaps a financial lawyer needs to look at it
Can you please review this format and provide your comments
The guaranty covers purchase/sale and swap transactions although our primary exposure is only physical natural gas
If there is no master firm agreement we send out our General Terms and Conditions with our confirmation
Thank you for the fax of the Columbia Energy GISB
Also please let me know what conclusion you and Ellen have reached in regard to the long-form/GTC issue.

Thanks for making time to see me today
We look forward to having you join The ICE soon
I am sending Kevin a memo today with the new language
I made the two changes
I am couriering over execution copies today
I found one more typo
As such we will not be receiving a Parent Guarantee on their behalf
But it does have the letterhead
I think these are all fine but I wanted to run them by you
I will give you more details when I get them
I just sent the agreements to Rain
I guess I am losing my mind
I will send them to Mike right now
If they are acceptable please have them signed and sent to me for further handling
I am working on getting the number
It may take me a little while
Friday works for me
I am open all day
I am out of the office today
I am at home with a sick baby
Here are the enovate confirms that we discussed
Dan did a confirm for Oneok which I do not have
I have not heard anything from him
I am going to Chicago tomorrow on business
I am going to have dinner with Esther on Thursday night
I ran into Jennifer Minnis at a GISB meeting
She said that you are not doing Broadband anymore
What are you doing
Here is how to get a hold of me next week
I do not think that my pager works in Arkansas
Do not hestiate to call me
Was the internet service provider installation performed to your satisfaction
Did the installer leave your premise without damage
Did the installer leave your personal belongings in tact
Were additional charges required of you
Have you received your internet service bill
Was your internet service bill accurate
Where do we stand on this
I will be happy if you can review this
I am negotiating the master
I will try to call you soon
Can you do lunch now that you have a new job
Then we went on vacation for the past week to Kiahwah
Oh and I switched jobs
I am now the Managing Director of our internal trading platform
I miss Jennifer she was really great to work with
Anything else new with you
Paige had her baby
A little boy named William after his pop
She has taken to motherhood and absolutely loves it
Call me when you get a chance
I am fine with the change
Please review and let me know what you think
I would run this by Harry also
I am fine with this product
I have approved this product
I have incorporated the definition of Strike Price
I am fine with this amendment to the Transaction Agreement
I would assume so
I had a couple of minor changes to the Reimbursement Agreement
Attached is a redlined version which shows my changes
Here is the master as I think it stands
There was a typo in the one I sent yesterday
I just caught a typo in the Spot version with credit
That language was added based on what our credit department wants
Other than that I am open
I will wait for your call
I found the correct version
I was in the MSN DSL pilot
I could not tell from the ClickAtHome intranet
Nothing would make me happier than reviewing this guaranty for you
Do you know the answer to this
Per you request attached is our standard form of incoming and outgoing guaranty
Where did you get them
Here is the sentence that we discussed
I just returned from a four month maternity leave
I have not seen executed documents
Jeff gave me the Conoco agreements to work on
Unfortunately I do not remember what he says needs to be done
Do you recall where we stand with them
I did not do this deal
Do you still need me to modify the PG&E amendment
If so please forward it to me
We will send you a fully-executed original for your files
She has not returned my call
Donna Jeff Hodge asked that I respond to your e-mail
I have attached a copy of that agreement
For those deals we use our Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement that I have attached
Attached are my suggested changes to the above-referenced confidentiality agreement
Let me know what you schedule
I have reviewed Mary's comments on the Nipsco contract
If Nipsco will not make the changes I still think it is acceptable for enovate to sign the agreement
Jeff asked that I review TradeSpark
If these are the only descriptions of the products on TradeSpark they are completely inadequate
I have reviewed Mary's changes and I am fine with them
However I did remove the secondary delivery point concept
I found a copy of the confirmation letter for this deal
Please give me your fax number
I am sending a copy to Wade Price as well
I could not find the cover letter that went with it
My office was moved while I was out for maternity leave
I don't think I ended up with all of my boxes
Could it have been sent to ENA in error
Susan I have access to the official paperwork
What exactly do they need
Do you remember what our concerns were
I have sleep since then and do not remember
I am faxing it now
Attached please find the above-referenced agreement for your review
Thanks for your help on such short notice
Please let me know of any changes
Please let me know if they are acceptable to you
It is our intention to execute all documents simultaneously
Here is NUI's response to your comments on their guaranty
Please let me know your comments on their response
Please let me know if this does not work for you
I left a message for the Coral attorney this morning
Do you think this is sufficient or should we be more specific
I have three minor changes to the agreement
I have attached a red-line version reflecting my changes
Jeff is familiar with the concept if you have any questions
Can you please review the reimbursement agreement and if acceptable prepare execution copies with initials
Any questions or comments please let me know
I think this is the easiest way
If they push back I have marked the specific sections that we need to include at a minimum
Can you think of anything else that I am missing
Mark please send me the updated model
Per our long rambling voice mail
Please review and let me know if you have any comments
Why do we need to negotiate and execute another GISB agreement
Did you not receive this
Please review and give me you comments
Thank you for your help in chasing down the master
Here is NUI's response to your latest comments
I have reviewed the Guaranty forwarded last evening by Rudwell Johnson
He requested that I get back to you with comments
Please note my changes on the attached
I do not have access to that database
Attached is the Master firm that we have negotiated
I think this would solve a lot of our problems
I will let you know the outcome
Brad I spoke to Evans King today
I will work on resolving this with him
Should he or his client call you refer them to me
They don't need to bother you about this
I got your message late Friday
Call me if you need anything further
As we discussed
Do you know who initialed this agreement
I want to talk to him/her about this provision
Anything we should beware of
I will send it to NUI when I hear from you
Per my voice mail
Please review the Coral Transaction Agreements and give me your comments
If we are doing business under any of them we need to get new cotnracts in place
She should start talking before long if she has not already
I'm sure that you are teaching her to say Stacy
I hope you guys are doing well
I understand Mr Espey is not doing as well as hoped
When do you think that you will be in Houston again
We miss you guys
We got used to your being around last year
She is starting to sit well on her own
It really makes her mad when she does
She loves her exersaucer
We only feed her twice a week which does not help
I will send some picutures of Meredith soon
Stacy upon receipt can you please generate the final agreement
I will look for the overnight
Please let me know if there is anything else outstanding
I don't think there would be any system changes required
I know you're on a project please let me know if you can check this or who can
Here is the original memo we discussed earlier
Please provide any information that you may have
Who are our TW accounting business users
I have no other information but you might check with the business folks for any system changes required
I talked with Steve about this bullet
What do we need here
Today we have contracts from Ignacio to the Blanco Hub that= then continue on Transwestern on another contract
Attached is the spreadsheet updated for the I to I deals
Don't forget to submit your time reports by Thursday morning
Is it revenue or something else
Kevin Tracy Steve Paul - Let me know if you think these are not the right assumptions
I will be sending you additional info for the various cases
Hope this helps and concurs with our discussion today
Attached is the preliminary January California monthly report for your review...our last one yeah
Will they be sending it to me for review
I need to get Michael or Davis to add
I realize the timing is not great for my surgery however is there really ever a good time
I actually planned this over a month ago
I didn't get a response from Tracy yesterday so I'll ask you
Do you know if that's happening
Will you be sending the location
I would think that you should
Sorry I didn't see the questions below
In the former case our debt holdings are understated and in the latter they're overstated
Please let me know which method I should use
Tracy could probably break it apart for you
Note that it is non-cash non-tax but it represents a large reduction in equity
Then there must be a problem elsewhere since it is supposed to be gone by itself
Detail schedules show why just want to make sure it makes sense
I guess the last bullet kind of sums up our caveat
Hopefully I got it right this time
Thank you all for helping on this
Did you have any comments
I need something in the next hour if possible
Gina I am waiting for Steve to respond to two e:mails I've sent him requesting comments on the slide
Should I call an estimate or is this actual
Also any changes on the slide I sent yesterday
Please let me know if you need anything else from me
Are you thinking of someone else
Did my voicemail address your question from yesterday
I have no way of seeing the slide on my Blackberry
Do you want to fax it to my hotel
I can look at it tonight
Please let me know if there are any scheduling conflicts
I was asleep at the wheel there
This is my understanding too
We have to pay the ACA if we discount it away

I didn't know how much detail we should get into

Let me know your comments
I'll wait until I get our comments
Do we need to run this by SoCal
Can you spot what's wrong with this picture
It may take you a minute

Since it is expired I can't really figure out how it affects CAS
But I will also look in the file
I have nothing to report

Our trip home was not what we expected but it could have been worse
I not only miss Sam but I miss your warm weather too

But in the excitement Enron lost touch with its mortality not to mention morality
Mr Skilling wanted it to become an alternative to the Wall Street banks
As the names flashed on a projector the bosses graded them
But they could double that when bonuses were added
To the outside world Enron described itself as a family for which employees were delighted to work punishing hours
Inside it became increasingly incestuous sexually and financially
They began pulling out as much money as they could
Then they asked for more
Senior executives began selling their shares in huge blocks
Yesterday Mrs Lay said her family also lost its fortune
Are you a Beethoven afficionado
Any progress on our access
I am having problems getting in
Gaffney told me to ask you about your dance partmer
So my answer is I don't know

Did you guys do anything last night
Learned a little bit about trading from him
What are her measurements again
I think the ran the spell check
I think Red Deer might be and even better buy
You actually passed her when you walked out
You have to remind me about that stuff otherwise I'll forget
She's wearing a pinkish shirt today but she might have had a jacket on when you passed her
As you can tell...I don't matchmake very pro-actively
If you factor in inflation you'd be getting a negative return on your investment
They are also set to inherit considerable wealth from their parents a factor expected to affect their housing choices
Come if you can make it
Oh you'll buy my chicken
I will pay you when you come home
Thank you very little
Hopefully I will see you guys over the holidays

This is a simple psychoanalytic test to measure your memory
Memorize it and open the second
If you can find five or more you are of above average intelligence
I should put a sign on my desk that says that
It sounds like English but I can't understand a word you're saying
I can see your point but I still think you're full of crap
I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you
What am I
And your cry baby whiny-ass opinion would be...
Sarcasm is just one more service we offer
Whatever kind of look you were going for you missed
Must you marinate in it

Hope your golf game and chika are doing equally well
Drop me a line if you get a second
Do you have aol or msn
I would like to RSVP my wife Laura and myself
We missed you at gas fair
It just wasn't the same without you
When are you comming back
Please give me your offer
Mike is putting pressure on me
He might turn it down there are rumors to that effect
Per Mike Grigsby we need a physical product setup for delivery at Pacific Gas Transmission Company - Stanfield
Currently I cannot view Canadian Gas products
I need to have access to those products
Thought you would like this
If so would we be using Tenaska transport agreements or ENA
Originally we were working on a spot deal for this day
Then after the fact we agreed to let the deal fall out under the exchagne deal
I apparantly forgot to change the deal ticket
Due to operational issues we agreed to receive gas all weekend and batch the deliveries on Monday
If you intended for us to prorate this gas I will need your OK
If a different price was worked out with Darren I do not have record of it
Sorry for just now getting back with you
Do you agree with this
However I never heard back from anyone
Cindy has left messages with Koch but she has not been able to resolve the issue
Do you have any information regarding this issue
With regards ti the Koch Midstream you could talk to Daren Farmer about it
Because things were not set up I could not enter the deals until now
I am sure there are questions just give me a call
When do you need everything
Do we contact the employeesindividually
Below you will find the number of cards we have that were purchased for your group
If so please provide me with a Co and RC# along with room location
I was out last week so I am just now getting back with you
Thanks for your spreadsheet
It seems like we took care of this earlier
It's a little hard to read but that's the way I got it
I have made these adjustments
HOwever I would like for you to double check August
I fixed it
I have those amounts below
I have no idea why payment would be suspended
I don't remember having any problems with Ocean Energy
However they did deliver gas to us at Cotton Valley
We have not received any statements from Duke yet so there is nothing to verify our volumes
I rolled this deal for day one in October only
Has it terminated or should it roll for October
I don't think that Vance nom'd anything
In order to manage our postion and schedule the gas we need to put the deals into Sitara
We will enter spot deals with the info Vance gives us
Let me know if you have any quesitons
Additionally we will need this information from the plant manager
I have rolled or input the following deals for October
When I tried to roll another month I got a message that another contract was needed
I have corrected the deal in Sitara
Let me know which is correct per the exchange agreement
I think Mark got everything in last night
Look into it and let me know how it looks
I will probably be out of the office on Monday returning on Tuesday
What do you think about increasing the fee
Just a note to reiterate what we talked about yesterday
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns
Well I got selected
The judge estimated that we would probably be there through Friday
If you need anything you can leave me a voice mail or call Liz and Stacey
This is a purchase that we obtained with the CES deal
Please look into this and let me know where we stand
Let me know if you have any questions or problems
Please let me know if this is correct for these contracts
Never used it
If so please let me know how you like it
If you don't use it and/or aren't interested in using it please let me know this as well
Please let me know if enter a deal
You can roll this if you need to
If we do the fee this way we will not double up the volumes
I can't just input a dollar amount in Sitara
Let me know how you want to handle it
Shouldn't we have only one buyback for each company
Also how do you have the meter set up to allocate between the ENA contract and HPL contract
The mornings will be the best time to learn but you can spend as much time as you want
I think it will help me very much in my role
However I still need to have the Oasis Contracts returned to me
Please return them in interoffice mail
So we don't need to sign the contracts you sent earlier
We appreciate your courtesy
I have entered deals into Sitara
Please let me know of any concerns/questions
Let me know what you find in MOPS
I corrected the deal
Elizabeth Sorry I can't remember if we had talked about this pricing issue or what
Duke believes our price is too high
I think the system pulled in the wrong price
We're working on it
I am having a problem though with the way it is coming to settlements
I think this is confusing the system some how
Also we still need the purchase deal for Tenaska IV
James is calling me every day asking for an update
I have attached my spreadsheet so you can see the numbers
I do not have Access on my system
I will try to find the meter numbers for these locations
I don't think we will be using them much
So it may be a few days before I get the info together
If you need anything else let me know
If you have something else going on don't worry about being there
I'll relay the info to you
I will let you know the conference room soon
Ask them about their Lone Star transport allocation
Who does Lone Star show as the transporter on their side if anyone
Do we have an OBA at this point
Thank you for your time and patience
Carlos should be able to tell you when
It appears as though we need to move the volumes from Pipeline to Operating at the very least
The above ref'd deal was from Jul do you want to extend it for one day
I will play again but not on Wednesday nights
Let me know if I need to provide further information
This occurs with a few of our industrial points
I'm working hard for you
I need a new lawnmower so I'll try to bump it up a little more
If you want a CD copy of this web site give me a yell
If you run into problems viewing any of the pages/pictures please drop me a note
Is this something that your group would look into
I am open after that
If you have any questions or conflicts please call Laura Harder
And how big around is it
So I think that she is trying to stay on top of this now
Otherwise I have had limited intreraciton with recruiting
Let me know if you need any other information
How do I go about finding out who this belongs to
I thought about ringing Texaco but wanted to check before I made any calls
I mean it this time
Thank you for your fantastic responses to our reservations request
If you are planning to spend the night you do not need to respond to that option
Thank you so much for your help
After trading and when you get a second can you go into the IT website and approve it
Therefore we are waiting on them
So we shouldn't pay for this gas
If you have any more questions please let me know thanks
I don't think I can allocate April's volume to March production
Could you please let me know what needs to be done
Just present your credit card at check-in
But somebody has to make some money I guess
I am surviving myself
We will send more pictures as they come
I am thinking that the measurement must be incorrect
She is too cute to have anything to do with you
I changed the deal ticket
If you have any question please call me
Let me know if you don't see this happening
When actuals come in you can give me the volumes and I will change the demand charge
This means that we can't change the location volume or price on these deals
I created a new deal to capture this flow
Management create an accounting arrangement for it
I tried to do this but I got the message to add a contract
Please let me know when this is set up
See if Tetco allocated the vol to their contract
However they selected a July thru October deal by mistake
Coral is not reporting anything on the deal since it was unwound
Again they will not have a record of the deals
Do you want to arrange a buyback for this activity
Can you set up a GTC with Duke Energy Field Services,Inc
How do you want to handle it
Republic Royalty is one of my CES deals
I will finalize my pathing tomorrow Thursday and set up buybacks and swings by the end of day Friday
Robert How do we look on the industrial deadlines
I am a little concerned with the long weekend coming up
Additionally we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running again
I hope this helps...THANKS
Can you all meet this afternoon or tomorrow to discuss this
If we could all do a little homework
I will get something scheduled for next week to discuss further
I understand that this type of transaction is currently done over-the-counter
Also due to the varying 'optionality' do you think these three different products will require three different Product Types
Please feel free to call if you have any questions
Was wondering if you had time to look into this
I am not seeing this in Sitara
Could you please confirm
However we have a zero as the expected volume
Could you please create a deal for this
Will you break out this spot deal separately
I am not sure what I should tell them
He will be handleing the scheduling for us
Who all would you like to have Liz interview with
I got in trouble the last time I exposed myself
I extended the deal
I am really not looking forward to my vacation
Please submit your July vacation as soon as possible
I would be interested in talking to Liz
With your help I will be able to achieve this in the quickest time possible
I got your name from Doug Leach

Do you want me to adjust
Do you want me to adjust anything

Currently we are buying gas in the Waha region as HPLC
Please let me know when we can get these contracts assigned
Or we need to enter into new agreements as HPL

If so you can adjust the deal and have the East desk approve it
As usual thanks for your help
Is it o.k
Anita have you found out any further information about this meter
Encina still beleives that we owe them for this gas
Can you please take a look
After a few days have flowed we will look at all the wellhead volumes and adjust if needed
Do you want me to enter the revised volumes
The position reports to me and is budgeted
Attached is the job posting for my group
Did they deliverit to us at HPL
Or did they cut Richardson
Or are they showing that we have gas stranded at that point
Please look into this and let me know
When I talked to him today he hadn't seen anything
He checked the numbers sent to him by Tufco
I have gone back into MOPS and corrected these volumes
I am confused about Praxair though
Let me know if you need something like that
If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals will this give me everything that I need
Would they show up in Sitara

If you are not could you please let me know who I need to speak to

As I talked with Brian the King Ranch set up as he is negotiating will be simplified
The intent as I understood it is that we will no longer buy at the wellhead
Daren Pat and Stella Daren Brian said he would get with you to discuss the deal in further detail
If any rates are changing then those need to be changed in our systems also

You should use the best information you have from prior months
Unfortunately I do not allocate PGEV
If we are short at Katy I would think that we would be long at Dewville
Also for December you may need to ask PG&E where they show the delivery for Western
In any case we don't have deliveries to make
Please let me know if this will work
I need to get back with Settlement today
Thu I'm not sure if this is your meter or not
Would you please make the necessary adjustments

If so should we alert them to the gas quality issue early on
As a precaution we are starting a trend and I want to be very cautious
Once we connect a well we can't go backwards
Anita - I need some accounting arrangements created for two meters
Are you looking into these variances
Please let me know the best way to correct the problem
I suspect the variance is showing up as a transport imbalance

I don't think I've really ever had a professional image
Do I have to shave
I don't think I've ever been anywhere on time
This whole meeting thing is going to be difficult for me
Just thought you needed to know
Understanably you may need some people covering desks and phones who won't get to attend
With the changes in personnel on the desk we don't have a lot of info to dispute their price
No price was negotiated that I can find
However since gas did flow I rolled the last price on the deal to cover those days
Sorry I could not be of more assistance
Do I need to bring a pen and paper
Let me know what you think and I'LL get after it
Ken developed an industrial report before he left
I need you to update this for March
This will need to be distributed to Gas Control Logistics and myself
We lose our audit trail and we can potentially expose ourselves from a Legal standpoint
This is mandatory for the commercial guys and Tom is trying to get me in also
Can you please verify that you made this purchase from Swift
If I should forward this to someone else please let me know
I am not sure about the rate
Elsa/Daren- do either of you remember this deal
If you have any questions or want to verify this information I would check with the Global contracts dept
I'm somewhat limited on my transport right now
I will look into the possibility of increasing the volume though
If you can increase the deliveries at Fuels Cotton Valley that will work
But she will be able to give you an idea soon
If they were we can change the deal
Stacey is out of the office today I hope you can help
If you hear of this point coming back into service please notify me
To help with the discussion I have maps which highlight the main points and areas where we transact
I did this with the Logistics group
I think it went pretty well
I am sorry I completely forgot to provide you with the meters there should be a total of eight
Please let me know when you have it set up
George wanted to know and asked me
I am helping volume management creat an accounting arrangement
I wanted to confirm that these volumes sound reasonable for you
What have we done in the past
I had the typed the deal numbers incorrectly
So you will need to set up accounting arrangements to get the nom into POPS
Thanks for your help Robert
Could you get someone in your group to set these up for Fred please
I will be at an offsite meeting today
Stacey Neuweiller will attend in my place
Leave me a voicemail if you need me to do anything
I know you told in the meeting the other day but I didn't write it down
For example we are giving an HPL training session today
With the rate of turnover we have experienced in the past it seems like some knowledge has been lost
I looked into this deal
This discrepancy should have been found before we closed out January
Since the gas apparently flowed we will have to apply the overflow to the OBA
Unless you can find a missing transport contract
I am sure there is no pricing on those days
You can bring the curtains when you come
Thought I would bring them
Answer & let me know if that's ok
Hope sweet Cole is feeling better over his cold
I will let you know the location when it becomes finalized
If additional information is required regarding this matter please let me know
For regions with multiple zones I have highlighted the zone where I believe the points should be set up
So I can't make this meeting
Let Kim know when you have this done
The way that the contract is set up does not fit into the systems as they are
Please let me know I'd appreciate it
So come to the meeting with any questions you have on HPL anything is fair game
I will let you know when that is finalized
Carey told me that he has already talked to Jennifer
He should be able to give you any information you need
I will get a conference room and lunch set up
I will send out an e-mail invitation to everyone in your group my group and the risk group
Let me know the best time for you and your group
I am not sure whether an ECT transport should be attached
I hope you have some insight on this issue
Let me know the what works best for you
Earlier in the afternoon is usually best for me
You may want to talk to Kenny Soignet but I thought that storage contracts were entered manually in POPS
He tells his wife to take all three of them
I hope that you enjoy this as much as I did
Just send the curtains whenever you get the chance
I love ya'll
I can meet anytime Monday afternoon
I was not able to schedule anything for today
In case you were please disregard this notice
If you had fogotten this can serve as reminder
Do you want to send Stacey in your place
So exclude that time from our possible meeting times
I apoligize for the late notice
But Exxon will not have them broken out
Daren if you have time please join us in this meeting
O'Neal This relates to the deals I have asked you to modify
If you have further questions they can be address at the meeting
Can we start this meeting later
And she is my backup on managing our position
So I need to be on the desk during trading
I rolled the deal for Jan and Feb

I can't be there
If you cannot attend please let me know ASAP

Also if applicable correct spelling of your better halves
I am not available at that time
I do not know whose HPL nom files these are
Please re-send if you have not already
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter
Did not want to change anything in Sitara without your knowledge
For the first part of the month you should nom the zero to POPS
Beginning tomorrow we will have volume out there on this ticket
I will work with Craig Faulbaum on this
If so just e-mail the details to me
Please add Pat Clynes to your distribution list
I have explained what a problem this causes your group and we are working on a solution
Have we gotten a ticket setup yet
So please allow Gary and/or James to talk with him first
I do not have the actual for Vidor CG yet
This does show up on my meter exception report
I think I hate football too
If I would have known about it on Saturday I would have called to console you and the family
Ugh -- I hate football
What happened to you guys
You had them by the clankers.
Someone just needs to let me know
As it stands it looks like we have a long position
I thought Carlos was handling this one but I could be wrong
I viewed prior month transactions and pathed appropriately
This can wait until we get back next week
If it is left unresolved I will get it pathed when I return
I haven't had time to do this yet
I assume that you are looking into this
Here are the days I have discrepancies with PG&E
Please let me know which numbers are good
Would you please forward comments to your manager
Hey I think that we are coming in this weekend
If not what transport contract do I use
This new deal is not to replace that one is it
Ken Thanks for your input
I will definitely take this into consideration
Also I want you to know that I really do appreciate all that you've done for me
Thanks also for your honesty and openness
I really appreciate you telling me when you disagree it helps me see things from a different view
I just wanted to let you know that
But I want to make sure that is what we need to do
I would just copy the TXU deal below
I believe the pricing is the same
Why couldn't they figure this out
You can call Vance Taylor and he can probably tell you
The rest need to retain their access
Why do you keep changing your e-mail address
How were your first few days back at school
You haven't burned down your home making class have you
Anyway hope you have fun this weekend
Please call if I can be of any additional assistance
Hi Julie I have a question and I wasn't sure of who to start with
In order to get this deal into the system who do I need to talk to
I have asked Robert Lloyd to look into this
He handles our Industrial noms now
Can you help me out on this Darren
In OSS you can manually enter the contract you need to allocate the volumes
I will consolidate our responses from a Logistics perspective
In order to get the ball rolling we need to get a list together of the reports we need
If you do not want any reports please send me an Email letting me know that
Can you provide me with a complete list of GMS reports
Clay I have had several requests from the ENA business groups
I don't mind going with you for the first couple of times if you need me to though
We are putting together our January calendar
These people still need the Sitara access they currently have
Have they moved on to another group
Please let me know so that I can update their access accordingly
Please update their security to allow for this
Please let me know if there are any questions or concerns
For being so patient Path Manager will now highlight your EOL deals in yellow
Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions
In case you were not aware you have the ability to control the Date display format on your PC
Please forward to others in your area that may be interested
Daren I have several months that need to have the demand charges either added or adjusted
When Katherine gave you the numbers the first time there were some spot deals included in the exchange deals
I have listed the changes below
Let me know if you would like to see the spreadsheets
I did not receive any more customer nominations
If not all of the traders have reviewed the estimate and made their changes
I feel pretty confident that this is a good number
Thanks and Merry Christmas to you and yours
Daren - I need your help in resolving this issue
Please let me know which number is correct
I marked the evergreen flag
FYI - what do you all think
Just to clarify its not the relative age of the production date but the age of the event itself
I will be out of the office next week
What can we do
I need you to do the research on this meter
This is also the volume that I confirmed with Mirant
I highlghted some changes on your spreadsheet
Look over these and call me if you have questions
A couple of the deals have Gas Daily tiers so I moved them down in the sheet
I believe that I have received your message in error
I don't have any problems with this
Stacey did leave so I am back to trading Waha
I am actualy enjoying it somewhat
Well that was too slow for him
Now he get's on his belly feet up in the air and slides down barely skiming the stairs
He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank except on his stomach
Cole runs over Jake with his toys pushes Jake out the way or just walks right over him
It doesn't affect Jake though he gets right back up and keeps on going
Anyway I need to get back to work
Maybe you can come down for lunch next week
I'll give you a call in the next couple of days
Did you survive bid week
Do you have any staff left
Just giving you a hard time
Almost have my *&%$#
Darren Thanks for your patience
Call me when you have the time to go over this
Let me know if you want to handle this differently
I am not going with AEP
So please don't include me in your estimates
Thank you in advance for your cooperation
If you don't have a record of a spot deal the allocation should stand as it is
Were you able to find anything out about this
Can we verified this gas flowed
Do you have any record of this
Could you verify if this is correct
If it is then we do need to change the price to GD
He told me all new production should be entered at IFHSC
Do you want it changed to Gas Daily
I don't know what you're smokin up there but every one of those deal numbers you listed are WRONG
This our ols friends at Pawnee gas plant fuel
Did you use the same deal ticket
What's the length of your boat
Does it have a cover
Please let me know your location
Tess can you follow up on this and let me know if you have any questions
You can charge it to mine
I changed the demand fee for Jan
I agree with the header charges
I will leave a copy of the contract in your chair
I've also adjusted the spreadsheet based on our conversation yesterday
Take a look at it when you get a chance
Tenaska owes us some additional money
I have attached my netting spreadsheet if you need it
I got your message regarding Apache
For the spreadsheet I am just going to prorate the actuals based on the noms
So we should not need a buyback for ENA
I told her I didn't have the authority to do this
She wants it added to keep the ENA deal whole
What do you suggest
I need this deal to create buyback
Let me know if there is another way
Why do you need it extended
Which meter are you having problems with
I am so sorry...I don't know what's wrong with me
If you can't extend this deal please let me know
I don't have access to this ticket
Could you please extend the deal
Where are you going
I have made the changes mentioned below
But we do use parking and lending agreements regularly
We don't have storage on PG&E do we
I think that is park and lend
I have put together the schedules for Spindletop and Bammel
So far I have only received information on Cove Point
David I believe that we already have the information for Bammel
I would like to have this information as soon as possible
We need to reduce our payment to Duke
When I adjusted the over delivery charge on the days we didn't nom the demand amount changed
I waited until Duke agreed before I sent you this change
For this meeting I will need a laptop and a projector in the conference room
Can you take care of getting this for me
The person who can tell us should be in tomorrow
I will leave a note for her
I will check with Mark and Trisha
Let me know if you need copies of the invoices
I wasn't sure what the receipt meters would be
Since I have very little knowledge in this area I didn't get much specific information
But I told him I would find someone for him to talk with
I would appreciate it if you would give Sam a call
If you aren't the person he needs to talk to please let me know
There were some ammendments to the contract reducing the demand charges that we did not have
I don't have any contacts at Lone Star related to allocations
When she returns tomorrow I will have her give you a call
Also we have not been able to get a contact for the allocation statement
Anything else that we need from you I will call you
Since I was out of the office most of the week I missed reading this e-mail
Can you please put this in so I can bill
I subtracted the agency fee from the Tenaska IV receipt number since we already have that booked
Can you look into the Transport piece
Can you tell me about these
What ever you need
I will be here the rest of the month
We may be interested in your sofa
Send me the pictures when you get a chance
Now that we are moving we've got a few empty rooms
I have pictures I can e mail if you are interested
Which price should I add
Please let me know what you find out
Liz - I would like for you to attend also
I checked with Cheryl Jones and the flow is good
Do we need to put in a deal for this flow
I HAVE NOTHING TO PAY HIM
She said that she passed it on to Fred Boas
Why are we not being allocated any volume
Let me know if you need me to extend them
Guys Just thought you might find this interesting.
I was forwarded this poem and told it was written by a high school student in Az
And anytime my head I bow Becomes a Federal matter now
In silence alone we must meditate God's name is prohibited by the state
We're allowed to cuss and dress like freaks And pierce our noses tongues and cheeks
To quote the Good Book makes me liable
We can elect a pregnant Senior Queen And the 'unwed daddy,' our Senior King
We can get our condoms and birth controls Study witchcraft vampires and totem poles
You can extend them but make sure that the volume is zero
But in the attached spreadsheet my cost center is grouped with Risk Management
Has someone else made this request or is this your own
Please call if you have any additional questions
Is the market loving you
I don't think I had it underpriced
Anyway we got what we wanted and made a little money so we were happy
Two days after we sold our house Tonya found the one she wanted in Oaks of Devonshire
But that's ok with me
Anyway we are closing on both houses on Monday and moving Tuesday and Wednesday
We hated having to do that but it has really made a difference
Now you can tell that he feels so much better
Even those plastic locks you put on cabinets don't hold him
We'll see if that stops him
I don't feel so good when I'm writing all those checks
Let me know thanks
I have done deals with John at this point
Volume management said they are looking for their money
Let me know if you think it is incorrect
I changed the demand to a negative value
I don't know if this will work or not
If it does not work I can put the demand on the sale ticket
Can you make it negative
We need to reduce our payment
They agree with our spreadsheet so I need a demand fee to adjust the price in Sitara
Currently it only shows ENA
I understand that a deal was added in December for Midcoast but that deal was only good for Dec
Please move my group from Risk to Logisitcs
If you have suggestions or comments on the file contact either me or Mark
Since we haven't gone through actuals in the spreadsheet we may have to do some tweaking with the formulas
If you don't have access we can look into creating a new location on the O drive
So if you have ideas to make it easier or if you need something added let us know
I would like to receive the alerts
I don't have any open positions
We are buying a house and we have the inspection today
So if Bob ar anyone needs me they can contact me by pager or mobile phone
Do you want to take this on
Can either of you verify this
Did Janet negotiate something with them after the fact
Sherlyn will correct all the booking when she reallocates the meter
Jack Sandra at TECO seems to think you may have some information on how this deal should work
Any light you could shed on this issue would be appreciated
I forgot to get with you this morning on this
Can I change the tickets or will you
If you need to reach me please call me
Did we pay the wrong company
Is Cleco billing us
Should we put a new deal in with Cleco
If they are disputing the deal please let me know and I will clear this up with them
Grab me when you get a minute
I have your bonus and merit info
You're going to like it
With the new business we will need strong performers who know and accept their responsibilites
So in short who knows what I need to do
Should this deal have had some volume on it
I think I found the deal
Can I change it
I have not seen a deal for this
Let me know if it is legitimate
For the time being use the same nomination form you have used in the past
If I can be of any further help please do not hesitate to call me
I will use your decision for our bidweek postion
How would you want to handle for February nomination
Can you assist me in this
When the work is going on we can move that around
Pat - do you want anyone from HMS to attend
Could you please extend this deal or create a new one
I didn't pay any attention to the date on this message
If nothing else we can write it off
I don't think we can even process this request
I welcome your thoughts
Victor Can we go this far back
If they agree we can roll the deal
Thanks and if you need further information please let me know
In the documents I have I can't find a reason for the adjustment
I may be missing an amendment or something
I got your e-mail just fine
Is your computer fixed up now
Cole had a great time at his birthday party last night
It took him forever to go to sleep
He really loved the Blues Clues game ya'll got him
I think I'm tired of that game
He can't play it in the car anymore
It so funny to watch him play though
Anyway I need to go
I sent Cole's birthday present today
Hope he gets it on time
Let me know if you get this message please
Early afternoon usually works best for me
I can come up to your desk if that is easier
If the Super Saturday occurred on a different weekend I would help you out
However we have a pretty important family weekend coming up
Anyway I hope everything else is going well for you
I will call you in a couple of days
Unfortunately we don't have enough personnel to do the interviewing
To round out the Logistics team I am looking for one more interviewer
Will the candidate compete when compared to their peers
Consequently I have been cautious around these candidates as I would not want to set them up to fail
Assuming worst case that noe of you are available I would welcome other suggestions
In advance I appreciate your help
I will not be able to play golf or party
I was really wanting to go but can't make it
Well I don't know what I'm going to do
We will have a Texas Desk but I don't really want to continue here
I am just glad they finally anounced the sale
Anyway I meant to let you know how our Christmas went with the boys
He hasn't touched them more than twice
We started our house hunting last week
I think this is going to be a long process
I'm letting her make the first cut
I will come in on the second round
We have a few small things we want to clean up fix etc. before we list it
According to the other sales in the neighborhood we should make a little money
I hope everything is going well with you and the family
I didn't even pay attention to the date
I was thinking this was October business
So don't come in for us
Will you have logistics support here
Can you send me a copy of Pan Energy's spreadsheet for Sept also
Also they seem to be missing the overdelivery calculation in their spreadsheet
I corrected the deal ticket
I may be able to help reconcile some of this
Please let me know if you have any further questions or need additional information
Daren - After checking with MIPS you are correct
Have you negotiated a price on this
What do you want to do about this
Would you be able to tell why they were reversed
Please look into your notes
It also flowed in November with no nom it is currently on stranger's gas
Can you please take a look at this
I don't know anything about the transport either
But I would assume the rate remains the same
I have attached my spreadsheet
The number is based on noms so when we receive the actuals I will send you a revised number
Can you make this work
P Love - I am sure it is little consolation but at least you covered
Please print approve and return original to me
I don't think anything should be adjusted on the Dynegy deal
I thought that I knew you
I don't want to tell you to add any contracts because I am not sure about that
The track id I gave you was for ENA
Thanks and let me know if you need anything else
Alfonso I need for you to allocate your meter daily because we have tiered pricing this month
I want to thank you angain for your heart-felt generosit y
I tried to approve this a couple of times so it should be taken care of
Please add me to your First Delivery distribution
I have tried to approve this a few times but it does not appear to work
But they have a few friends who lost just about everthing
What made it worse was the freezing weather coming in
When we talked to Tonya's parents they were really in shock of bad it was
Have you been battling those Christmas mobs
I didn't last too long
Well I hope ya'll are doing good and staying in the Christmas mood
But I will make it work
James is out this afternoon and I am out tomorrow and Thursday
Please let me know ASAP so we can schedule a room
But I will discuss that with Legal
We can get together then if you would like
Unless the buys/sells are volumetrically balanced we book an entry to balance the desk
Is it addressed in the agreement with Tenaska
Tonya and I will be there
Also we may need to look at changing the Storage Agmt
Is there a way that we can get this done tomorrow
Robert please do your magic
I am not sure what these numbers are
But could you move them as well
I'm cool with it
Take a look and tell me what you think asap
Per Gary I am forwarding the below percentage split for Spinnaker
I have highlighted the split in Blue
I would like to get involved in finalizing plans for revenue distribution for the N Padre production
How do you recommend we proceed
If you need anything else or have any questions let me know
I need a conservative forecast per month of the price that could be obtained by selling our excess volumes
And I appreciate the time you've spent with me
However I would like to discontinue our sessions for the time being
Again thanks for working with me
Are you clear on what you need to do with this
He said that he will be buying your lunch since you wouldn't accept his x-mas present last year
If I can find somewhere to park.
Or give me a call from the Lobby and I'll come get you
It doesn't matter to me
Will we have a swing deal with them for the winter
And will probably adjust it again in a few days
Since we bridge back estimates daily the production at the Berryman well has been adjusted in the economics
From a physical standpoint I think that we are fairly well balanced
Or we can just meet in the lobby and walk over
I have rolled the Hilcorp deal
I will get Gary to look into the Williams deal
But we will never forget it
Tonya and I are going to the Aggie/K-state game
Looks like your corn boys will be playing OU that weekend
OU also has a week off to get ready for you
I can't remember if we've talked about the sale of HPL
I am hoping it does
I'm ready to go on to something else and that would make it much easier
How's everything else going for you and the family
I actually took last week off
Anyway would you be able to come down for lunch on Friday
Sorry I haven't talked to you much
Currently we have the September deal priced at Gas Daily also
I want to roll the deal for Sep and Oct
Volume management allocated volume to it according to the allocation statement
I noticed it is not out there for October either
I have corrected the ticket
I have created two new deals in Sitara
Can you look into this please
This is the last month we will be buying this gas
Could one of you extend the deal for this
I would be greatly appreciated
I apologize for getting this to you so late
I should have no staffing additions next year
I think that everything else should roll for next year
Let me know what else I need to give you
You can however use the exact amounts if you have them
If you forget these items I will make sure it is added to your budget
While I am out Gary Hanks will be keeping our position during trading
I am comfortable that everything will be covered
I will be back in town Thursday night
I would like to recommend a promotion for Mike Olsen
Prior to the sale of HPL all of our activity a= t the Katy hub passed through the pipeline
In essence I kept a sort of P&L for him
With the limited number of people on our desk I needed to split= my time between Logistics and Trading
Truthfully I spent the majority o= f my time with the trading
He acted as lead supervising and training Jay our other team member=
Please support him with a promot= ion
I have changed the deal ticket
In case you need it this is the phone list for volume management and settlements
I spoke with George Smith
Do you want me to order new equipment for George
Have you heard from Daren yet
Equistar won't pay the invoice until we bill it correctly
I know it's bid week
Did Spinnaker bill us at Index or Gas Daily
What did we pay
Let me know this and we can proceed from there
I will talk to him after I hear from you
It looks as though they have not been nom'd
Why have they not been nom'd
Could they be under another Dow company
Can you print the confirmations for me
Daren is the info that you need
Mary - Do you pay Spinnaker for gas purchases
Charlene/Cindy/Charles Can either of you answer Darren's question to me below
However we have been transporting the gas under ENA
Let me know if you have any more questions
I would think that the first contract should go the AEP
Is it a sale that is going to AEP
Someone let me hear what you think
Let me know if anyone has questions
I don't have all the deal numbers
Attached is an updated file on our pipeline contract situation
I haven't gotten much info from credit managers but I wanted to pass along their names and numbers
They can make it up after the outage
Did Gary or Lee ask you to do this
So we should not list them
Just let me know when it's in
Would you please get the George Smith and/or Daren Farmer
I don't think you will be moving to the other building
We still want you to work on the Texas desk
If you have any time I would like to discuss with you further the exact plans for me
I would like to slip right in and begin work immediately
I've got it covered
Please let me know if there are any questions
Let me know if I can do anything else for you
I have changed Sitara
Can you please verify the pricing
I have changed Sitara to agree with the contract
Well let me tell you what's' going on
So it is taking quite a while to c= omplete
He started out the doorway but came back in and walked behind me
I = just kept working thinking that he was watching me
When I turned to loo= k I just lost my breath
Cole has helped me wit= h some of the work such as sanding the walls
But he carried his work a = little farther than I wanted
Yesterday he had a friend over
I am taking a break this weekend though
Cole and I are going camping at L= ake Livingston
I am really looking forward to it
Last month I took Cole to his first Rocket= s game
He loved it
At work I guess I'm becoming a full fledge trader
But we'll see how it goes
Anyway I hope you and Linda are doing well
Hi What the heck is going on with you these days
When we are not operating under the swap Duke markets the gas that usually comes in at Castle Busby
Apparently they sold the gas to Highland in April
D Daren Did we exchange with Panenergy in April
If we did can you send me your nom sheet
I have corrected the deal ticket
I have changed the demand fee
But is this adjusted by the dollar amount that we need to recoup from Williams
I agreed to let them out of the deal
However due to the bankruptcy we could not make payments out
Please give me a call or e-mail me
I have the following as participants for the PreBid Meeting
Please advise if I need to make any changes
I'm sure they thought that I was superior though
I know you can use the system some how just not sure how
I have changed the price in Sitara
Rick O'Bannion the trader at Texaco has confirmed their price
Daren - Please see my e-mail to Julie below
Can you change the price for me
For once his is not a Panenergy question
Can you confirm this price for me
I don't think that the Agency agreement is going with HPL
If that has changed please let me know
I asked Dave Baumbach about it and he agreed with me
As far as signing the agreement I need one thing added
Darren do you know what the situation is with getting that Tenaska agreement signed
Thank you and Please advise
Please advise should you have any questions concerning the attached
The Williams invoice was not as much as the spreadsheet showed so our expenses decreased
I have attached the revised spreadsheet
Channelview I believe
That's where I put it
I will be happy to meet with you on Wednesday
I believe that Carlos Rodriguez handles this pipe
Does anyone know who in Logistics I need to talk to
Send it back to me when you get a chance
Yesterday I handled Waha pretty well
But I got bent over for the weekend
Did you have anything going on over Memorial Day
I hope ya'll are doing good
Are we able to settle any intercompany deals now
Are we able to settle with TXU
Can we pay intercompany bills
How should we go forward with this agency responsibility
Again thank you for registering for the AOL Instant Messenger service
Unfortunately we will not be able to make it Saturday night
We will be in Dallas visiting my brother and his wife sort of a late Christmas get together
I hate that we are going to miss it but I will touch base with you later
Myra has a friend who will be preparing a full meal for us served buffet style
So call a babysitter email me back and lets get together
Due to our agency activity on Lone Star I do not want to contact them yet
But I have a copy of a contract they sent me a couple of months ago we can use
Once we have those together I'll run the traps with Legal
STOP paying high prices for your Inkjet Fax Copy and Laser Toner Cartridges
Get FREE Black Inkjet cartridges for your printer while supplies last
If you have already sent the hours to me please disregard this message
Thanks for your time and assistance
Thank you so much for your cooperation in this matter
I don't know of any days yet
I will put together a master sheet from the individual replies
We are in sad shape aren't we
I was on vacation last week th= rough Monday
Other than concerns for my future everything is going fine
Things= really are ok I know I can get a job with AEP if I need to
I actually s= tarted talking to them about it
But on Wednesday they made a few changes= that I'm not so sure about
That person is our fast-talking friend Carey Metz
That blew me away=
My love= ly wife signed me up to be the coach
I'm going to get her for that one
Cole has already handcuffed Jake a number of times he loves it.= My vacation last week was very good
It was one of the best vacations I have had
Do you think your Huskers can pull it off=
I think OU's going to win it but it should be a great game
When do you think that I can get it
I will cover Katy and Carthage
Please do not hesitate to contact me
The entity I trade with is TXU Gas Distribution
D Can you make the change
I understand this is not the case
I f they haven't you can look into the old scheduling contact list and call El Paso and Dow
For El Paso Offshore we probably need points but I believe most of their system is in Matagorda County
I believe that we did have some activity on Blue Dolphin but it was done by the Wellhead group
I told them that we had none and that whatever they have is AEP business
I will call them for capacities and flexibility
Let me know if you have more questions
Please get back to me tks - Bob
But in the afternoon if they need payments out the door PM will get it
So if you send me who needs to be in the system no matter what that would help
Based on Victor's response I think there is some confusion
Going forward as a precautionary measure we will begin locking users out of the system if the need arises
The old list we had from Sybase no longer exists
I need your help in putting together a new list
The sooner I get this the sooner we can get this implemented
Thanks for staying on top of it all
I could have sworn that I sent you this information earlier
Again I thought that I sent this to you a couple of weeks ago
I adjusted Texas but not Wellhead
I also added the market hubs that we trade under the pipeline section
Please call me if you have any questions or concerns
I nominate Suzanne to collect the money
I didn't know if you got this or not
I can't wait to spend the next week with you
Where do you think you're going
Darren Did we sell any gas to TGLO for Sept
I don't see a deal coming into settlements
I was just thinking of you
How does your afternoon look on Tuesday
I've seen this already but it is worth repeating
A friend sent me this and I thought it was worth watching
I never doubted you
I have already sent your receipts
My October newsletter follows and I hope you enjoy reading it
I hope you enjoy this monthly newsletter
If you have any comments please e-mail them to me
Or if you would like to see a certain topic covered in future months let me know that too
I don't have anyone
You pathed it as a buy/sell
That is why we have not paid yet
I will let you know as soon as something is determined
To recap what we talked about this morning
Thank you in advance for your help with this
I also repathed Unify
I will have to check each month
But we had a = great Christmas
You can hear them= all through our neighborhood
The neighbors have already asked my what I = was thinking
He got them all
Jake was primarily interested in in opening presents he= didn't care what was in them
Well Jake was chomping at the bit to run through it
You should have se= en his eyes light up
My mom and sister ca= me in the weekend before Christmas
How was your Christmas
Was Santa Claus good to you
I guess your kids we= re in
I hope you had a wonderful time
Anyway I need to go make a call on a tee time
It doesn't make much sens= e does it
Are you still there
We are having some volume problems with this month so we may need to change it again
Please forward this to the appropriate person in your group
But we shouldn't have a problem
I love you alot
Can you re-send the file with the attachement
Thanks for your cooperation and attention to this matter
Daren Will you let me know when this change has been made
Darren If you're in the office today I need some changes to Tenaska IV
Our game with Texas was much better than I expected
I can't believe Colorado ran over Nebraska like that
I think that we are close to the end
So did you get the Christmas tree after the game
We'll see how it goes
I hope you had happy holiday even with the game
Can you take care of this
I don't have the access to do that
If he can change the name then we won't have to create a new deal and re-path
I just sent him another message today
Daren Have you had a chance to look at this yet
I just found out that Anthony has changed responsibilities
He said that he forwarded the message to Bridgett?
I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything
Have you taken care of this

If you have anymore questions please let me know
I found a website that has a lot of great ideas

Should I go back and path the deal changes
Rick Hill is my contact person for the project
Ple= ase give me a call when you get a chance

If I can fit into it I plan to wear one of my really nice suits
I'm so glad that you can go
I would love to go
I have it on my calendar
Let me know the appropriate dress
Please let me know if this presents a conflict
If it does we will keep the meeting as is

If you need additional information please contact me

I hope that this helps
I think that this company falls into your group now
Let me know how this turns out for future questions
Mary - Are we talking regarding Oklahoma Initial business registration booklet
Peggy - I have confirmed with Jerry Moore re Oklahoma Initial Business Registration booklet
Each business unit is responsible to file their own report section
Do you want to head over there together
We will confirm and let you know before noon tomorrow
Was this suppose to come to me
Are you still on for tomorrow
Please e-mail me your weekly report info before you leave today
I was suppose to do this a week ago
They had some nice things so I recommend it
RK I am so sorry to hear about your dad
I know how hard it is to lose a parent
Please remember that you are in my thoughts
Through shared experiences you were on my mind and it helped me through the process
Thank you for being my friends
If you could get back to me as soon as possible I would greatly appreciate it
Are you free next week for lunch
Wednesday works for me
Lets go someplace special since it is your birthday
Okay so I looked at the wrong month
Only comment that I have is good luck
Let me know if you have any questions concerns or comments
I would like an extra large t-shirt
Please encourage your teams to get as many donations as possible
Boy am I glad we didn't get up
Are we all through with the update back process
Please e-mail your weekly report to me before you leave today
Now that's how you write a letter
Your calculation looks correct to me
I will be checking the phone and my e-mail
I would like to attend
Was it crazy
I hope that it does
It sounds like it will be alot of fun
Hey I hear you might be going to DG's Halloween party
Hope all is well we really need to have dinner sometime in the near future
I hope that you are coming back out to Enron
He said don't panic it will get better
Well I am no longer at Plains and I am now back in the office
I am suppose to be going out to Enron next week but who knows
If I do get out there let's try to do lunch
I'll keep you inform of my schedule
Please send me your weekly report information before you leave today
How do you feel about taking on another company
Do you concur
Please let me know Monday morning
If you have not already made these decisions Essie's guidance should be helpful
Please see my comments in red below
So I suggest it be assigned to Leon
Not currently on our list of companies
Those dates work for me
Let me know your thoughts/availability for these dates
Thanks for catching my huge blunder
I know you had mentioned that you may change the hours
Lastly please forward me the September schedule when you get a chance
In the Resource Plan we can attach a premium for OOM up or down
I called Mark Patterson who is our Ercot Rep. and I explained the situation
I also wanted to know how this would settle
Since we indicated verbally that we could run the plant that changed our status from unavailable to available
If we are OOM'd up the premium will require that the heat rate formula is invoked
I mistakenly thought that the deadline was one year
Can I still get this in
I think I have everything in order
Any luck with the changes we have requested
We are looking at this for you
I will contact you tomorrow for any further required information
Can I get a change in Enpower
When this manual process does not get done we have settlement problems
Kim and John The benefits can be extended if they are expired
Debra can you advise
I travelled to Portland a week ago to visit friends
Anyway it was good to see Stewie Tim and even Richter
What are you working on here is it classified
I tried calling you last week and heard you were out
Who would I talk to about the residential customers
What about New Power should we refer this deal to them
We have a non-compete with New Power so we can not serve residential load
It would be a good idea but we can't do it
Unless your brilliance can find a way around the non-compete
Joe Do you have any record of this deal
I should that you worked this day
Let me know what you find
Alex Could you check your trade log for this
I show that you were on this day
If this trade is good we need to Enpower
Please check this out and let me know what's going on
If you have questions let me know
Double check your deal entry desks and zones
I intended to mention this last week and I forgot
Frontera tells me daily what Mirant is calling for
I replace this power or Frontera generates the schedule
Can we do this
No appology needed my friend
Linus can you give me the info for a New Power contact
I thought that this may be a good fit for NewP
Mr Hinson Sorry I missed your call
These units are behind a common point so the rules as they were written dont consider us
Yes I am still an Enron employee
As for the repor= ts I have been negligent in sending then around over the past few weeks
However I understand the need to dis= seminate the regulatory information and will resume the summaries forthwith=
These have changed so update your phone list accordingly
When you sell this cut the load and replace with the appropriate QSE trade
Please send me the results of your phone interviews
Please e-mail a yes or no for your candidates
Tom The Frontera file has in the first tab their calculation for their daily costing
Ken gave me this and asked me what I think
John have you had a chance to get this fixed
Please update me on the status at you earliest
The Resolution desk has given me the password
I have since submitted another E-request for George
The reason is he cannot log onto blotter or create deals under his name
Can you watch out for this
If that does not work please let me know
I have not heard back from either of you about this
Shall I make them all Hourly ERCOT
This is the book that he trades primarily
Have him log out of EnPower log back in and try again
I've got him set up in Blotter with East portfolio
Let me know if this did not work
One more thing I neglected to mention
Deal Blotter only refreshed lookups once per day the first time it is run
After that you must do it manually
If you have questions please give me a call as this is a very important issue
At that time I had left messages with all three candidates but was unable to reach them
I would recommend scheduling Nicholas for an interview
I will again call the other candidates
Can you please provide me with your feedback/status
If you have further questions please let me know
I will be short the Imbalance price during this time
Please transfer this imbalance amount to me
TJ Can we create an inbox folder for Joe
Yes I would like that very much
As you know Telerate is going away soon and will no longer be available
If you need additional assistance please give me a call
I have spoken with Ruben this morning
Additionally he has worked for the California PX
I then pay the pool price
Save the file attached below to your desktop
I used a similar tool in the California pool
Let me know your feedback
I am discussing this with Cara at Tenaska
Are we going to pay it
Rebecca Should I pay Tenaska
Rebecca Have we heard from John
Try to sell tonite if possible so we wont have to wake them up
I have sold the swap to Frontera for tomorrow
I sell fixed and buy floating
If you think that the pool will be high then you buy fixed and take to the pool
Net we are left with two fixed prices
Please note that when we will receive a unit specific instruction we will also receive a category one deployment
Yes Joe Capasso does report to me
Do we need to discuss this further
I just want to be on the same page
I will be attending a funeral tomorrow but I am available to meet on Tuesday
Thank you for checking back with me
Kim I need to speak with you at your earliest convenience
Jim Flores - did he also work in Finance
Stewie How is it going with baby Wolf
At least tell me about hiking
Kim I'm sorry I did not get to come to your open house
Frank I am interested in speaking with you further concerning investment opportunities
My view will be that the more success we have the more money I will be willing to invest
I am looking for other opportunities preferably within the company
Joan I left a message for you today concerning your e-mail
Do you still need someone
I would like to ask you some specific questions again so give me a call
I need to meet with you on this issue
I am currently in the Kellogg building
I saw Swerzbee and Motley at the K-derby
Good trip - see you there next year
If you could pass this along to the appropriate salesperson I would appreciate it
Thanks for asking - things are still pretty tough here but I determined to make it work
Also I asked him about the oil light and he seemed to think that the oil sensor needed replacing
However I am leaving town tomorrow and wont be back until Sunday
Maybe we can meet then
Thanks Bill for your time
Thanks for keeping me updated jackie
Are you glad to be back
Let me know what 's happening
I havent talked to brother Jimmy lately
He is not answering his phone here
Knock em dead in your new job
Bobby - How's it going in PDX
We cant buy transmission and hold it in this manner
Anyway I havent been accepted into the bubba club yet but I'm still trying
What am I missing here
Mikey Please see the attached and tell me if I am smoking crack
Duke is transmitting this power through their capacity through SOCO
Also let me know immediately if there are problems with this or any other schedule that I have
Judy I was accidently included on the distribution list for the retirement announcement from Omaha
Any relation as I dont hear our last name very often
Kim Can we meet around noon
I just returned from a training class
Can you meet a bit later this afternoon
Thanks for your understanding
Hey looks like I will be returning to Portland
Kim Thanks for spending time with me yesterday
I have spoken with Tom May concerning what my status was
My thought was that I need to relay this same message to Presto Doug and Lloyd
I will communicate this today unless you have other ideas
As discussed I have attached a copy of my resume
Anyway I will let you know how it turns out
I have asked Charles Taylor to give you a call
Based on our discussion I think he has some things that may be interesting to you
Stop by my desk if you want further detail
Congrats to you and your wife on your new arrival
Wherever I go I am ready to make an impact
Anyway I wish we could sit down have a beer and discuss but that's probably not practical
I know that you are out of the office but give me an e-mail when you get a chance
Amy Hope everything is going well with you
I dont know if Tim has talked with you but I am considering returning to Portland
I am talking with Wolfe and Tim but I would like to keep things low key
Had I known that it was a similar position to what I had I never would have left
However I have expressed to Kevin and Kim that my first preference would be to return to Portland
I would appreciate any feedback that you can give me
Jeff passed on your e-mail
I suspect other changes would ensue once I established this region
It looks like I will be returning to Portland
I dont mind doing anything as long as it's productive
There is interest outside of the company in me but I am under contract
I miss Portland and I think about it all the time
I must be a mountain man at heart
Well let me know if you have any thoughts on the above
Once again I dont wish to have this get out to anyone on the West desk just yet
I heard that you did really well on your home sale
Maybe I can buy back my house and my boat
How is your housing in Taylor
I miss the beer in PDX boating and the winter bowling
Do I turn those in to you
I am due the closing costs etc
Johnny however was not optimistic that he had anything available for a Director level position
He is motivated and challenged which is what he needed
As far as timing I dont know yet
I kind of wanted to work on the Ercot desk but not for Presto
Anyway keep in touch you wino
I don't think Ducks like to be called Beetles
As far as mascots go I personally don't see any difference
What changes do you see happening once ERCOT real-time is established
The more connections we have up there the better
It's all about you
Speaking of wine I am now an official of both white AND red wines
It was a lot of our friends we've known since Jr High
I drank more red wine than beer that weekend
Keep me posted on any new developments
I'm sure it will work out for the best whatever that may be
I think that this will take care of me
I am checking on your question
Also you can call one of the bait camps and get directions
Of course I would have to have all of this in writing
This makes the offer more attractive but still I would be in Houston
I am still apprehensive of the bait & switch exposure
I would like to know the detail of this transaction
I know that not everything has been discussed with this account so I would like to discuss it
Can you think of any exceptions
I will let you know when the weekend is complete
I still have a need for an Analyst within the group preferably for a one year rotation
Secondly are we getting the MCP or the Bid price within the Price Curve
Please contact us asap to rectify the problem
Clinton Due to the flood our phones rolled over to the Portland office on Saturday
I am working on some procedures and need some input
Juanster Can I get a copy of your group's expectations
As I understand it they all pitch in to do confirms and they unofficially cross-train in other regions
Michael we checked with Reliant personnel and they dont know anything abuot the fees that we discussed
I would think that some recognition would be in order
Even though everything was the same in both portals it remained red and unmatched
I have documented this in the QSE Mismatch log book
I hope this has been helpful
Here it is.
Okay so we now have a procedure
I still havent completed all of their discrepancy checkout
I have been working nights through the weekend and tonite
I will address these on Tuesday
Clint will be helping me to resolve these and future issues
However I am not getting any response
If you could get with him and give me a call we could try to close out May
I have asked that these responsibilities be officially committed to writing
These guys are in terrible shape here and I am needed
I report to Lloyd Will who is a great guy
I am working with Doug Gilbert-Smith who is the Ercot Term trader
I will be leaving the main office in February whether it is with Enron or not
I would prefer to stay with the company as my options are worth zero at the moment
We still want to return to Portland but right now I am needed here
Let me know when you are coming down but dont bring your sweater
Hope things are going well for you and your group
I'll give you a call later and tell you what's what
However you can use someone's while they are gone
If any of these lines should ring we need to be sure to pick it up
This can be a broad overview or we can drill down to specifics at your request
That's why she turned toward us
She is supposed to be our rep to the ISO and I talked to her explaining my expectations
Im cool with that but cant you find out
I am an Oregonian
I forgot about that bit of joy
Can we copy the profiles of existing team members
I am assuming they are going to shift
That's allright go ahead and cancel my order
We received your order through the Signature Shop for Astros tickets
We also need your EB location to have tickets delivered
If you have any questions please fell free to call
Save the attached link if you dont have already
Pull it out Sapien
Lloyd Thanks for your help on this issue
I think I have my facts somewhat straight but I am available to answer questions
Additionally we were short staffed due to floodwaters downtown
One of our service customers Teco wanted to sell some test power in South Texas
He maintained good detailed notes and was able to relay this information to me the following Monday
Please hold the presses before this gets billed to us
Amy I have elected to stay in Houston until at least February
A particular trader antagonizes until someone stands up to him then he has them sent home
This is not an unusual occurence on trade floors but I will not be any part of it
If we dont get buy in from the top I will also be at risk of going home
Some of these guys just dont get it
There are however many positives to staying here the guys I report to are like-minded concerning the above
Well thanks for listening to my sermon sister Amy
Hopefully there will still be opportunity for me at that time
So once again we have an extra purchase from HLP that we didnt need
Did you negotiate this with HLP
I'll talk to you about this tonight
Can you list my Monday time as my floating holiday
Lunch is tough but I will keep in touch
Can I buy you coffee or lunch one of these days
Wanted to find out what you guys are up to
Let me know when you'll be available
As you can see I am still a slacker
No really we havent been anywhere since we moved back in January
I will get back to everyone on the room number later
Lloyd Would it make sense to press our EES/West Point guys to a decision
We should express that we want to hire internally however we do have external candidates that we are considering
Also EES is petitioning Kevin for me to let Watt's go right now
John Where are we with this
Also make an effort to know why we run reports etc
However this will take an extra effort from each of us
If you have questions about any of the expectations ask
That is why we make the list
Don't spend it all in one place
Yes I can
I have already started working on this
Chris Watts will help me get this sorted out ultimately
You should see drastic improvement from our side effective immediately
Risk management/Settlements wants this balanced as we cannot tie out with our customers
You mention inadvertancy in your Notes but I dont know the particulars of this problem
Give me a call to straighten this out
Lloyd This is the guy I was talking about last week
I can answer any questions that may arise or I can put you in touch with Saji
Nice meeting you on Friday
If you have questions please call
I hope that you can make it
I will not be able to cover the RT shift
I know that you are working alot of days before then but I would appreciate your help
This initial guide should get you started however this is not a comprehensive handout that contemplates every situation
Otherwise we will be out of balance with Ercot
Make sure that you read/ study it and ASK QUESTIONS
Risk Management is creating this internal transmission counterparty for us
I will let you know what it is called
Attached are a few questions Steve and I have talked about
Dave its good to hear from you
We are in Houston and its hot
So tell me what you are doing now in Phoenix
Bobby I came really really close to coming back to Portland
I came to Houston to trade cash
I will be working with Doug Gilbert-Smith who is the term trader in Ercot
I am working with Smith and Jeff Miller as well
No boat anymore I'm bumming a ride with my friends
I did not know Brett was at the ISO now
How long ago did he make the switch
If you have an email addr
Not sure if you remember me telling you before I left PDX but Phoenix is my home town
I have been loving it
And the family really likes it here too
Of course it is hot as hell here too
From October to May the weather is great and that's when we do most of our out door stuff
Take care John and may God continue to bless you
However when we go live we will have to book out with our counterpaties prior to flow
This is for your information
However I am missing my notebook and my tradelog
If you use my desk and you need to move my notebook etc
Sorry that Johnny had not spoken with me but it will work out okay
Hope your training with Errigo went well this weekend
Sunny and I reviewed this situation on Saturday evening
Are we supposed to be ready today and if yes for what
We look forward to having you on the team
I am available most anytime in Augie as I havent put together the shift schedule yet
What dates are you available
I will be out of the office this Friday next Monday and Tuesday
I will be taking some vacation days
I agree and will make the arrangements
Settlements and Risk have blessed our version of the procedures
Now we need to run this by Teco
Should I call Frank Busot to discuss or is this an item for discussion in the meeting on Tuesday
Tj Can you price a flight for me to Tampa that would leave from Hobby airport
I could take an afternoon flight from Tampa to Houston Hobby
Brett I have a business question for a change
I know that there is South to North congestion but is this actual load right
Any help you can give would be appreciated
I am trying to see if the forecast is worthless
I will be calling on Friday to check on this
Remember I will be on vacation Friday and Monday
I was scheduled to take Tuesday off but I will have to attend this meeting
Please do not schedule a vacation day for me on Tuesday
Please add/edit as you wish
Thanks for remembering me
Hope everythnig is well with you too
I hope you are doing well and have a good Birthday tomorrow
In these instances we tried to contact the plant to instruct them to increase/decrease generation
They have refused in the past as they were only to receive instruction from Jerry
Thanks or giving me a moment to speak to you today
I am looking for something high paced something that will keep me busy throughout the day
I like it here at BTU but staying in this area is not presently an option
Remember to call her this weekend with any Frontera changes
Can we get a request in for him
Thanks for your attention to this very important issue
Steve Check this out- does this have any truth to it
I felt that if I shared what information I do have that would be considered a breech of confidentiality
Lloyd I spoke with Steve directly about Kevin's e-mail and concerns
Steve said that Dan of C.O.B contacted him inquiring about job opportunities here
Subsequently Dan and Brandon sent their resumes
I have spoken directly with Steve about this issue
I need someone immediately and Kevin could be plugged right in similar to Alex
Let me know - sorry for the very awkward situation
Had to copy you on this...dont be offended my friend is from Shreveport
I wonder if they've got a patent yet
Jerry Take a look and check to see if I missed anything
Do you have time to meet with George at noon today
I am going to talk with him again at this time
Michael how do you know which deals are the options if they are entered as forwards
I input into the comments but I was about to ask how these options get trued up
Amy How's it going
I was wondering how Jeremy was doing
It would seem that he has a decision to make though I havent heard of his progress lately
Did you have your vacation yet
Lloyd George has departed for his planned vacation
I bring him in at that time
Of course you can just knock on the door
In Ercot only we are allowed to exchange information with the control room
Remember that although we will get an answer the invoice may appear somewhat different
Of course the tariff overrules any answer that we may receive
Please let me know when this is completed
When do you want to come
The wife and I are expecting you and Richter this week
So when do I get to see the Palace
I am going to discuss this with Narsimha
I feel like a reply is warranted as we are making no headway on this project
Please talk amongst yourselves and set up meetings as necessary
Just keep me in the loop
I talk to someone different each time from EES
Please see the attached and let me know your comments
Please confirm that we can get this done
I talked with Rebecca this evening
Scott I heard that the TPC was in decent shape
How many people do you have in the group
Just checking to see if I have your email address correct
Did you find out anything on TPC
At the time of deployment we also receive the balancing energy price for the hour exercised
They can take partial hours at their option
It would be great if you could join us
Thanks for your reply
I expected to be able to include my employees as Juan and Don have now done with my spots
Don and Juan have invited my employee Steve Olinde with one of my original spots
The only room we have now if for one
Ben Could you come by I have a question about rearranging our phone turrets
I can play alot of golf on Saturday but I need to spend time with the wife on Sunday
I will be available for the golf marathon on Saturday
I have one player for Saturday morning but I dont have a player for Sat
Should I fill this spot as well
I DIDNT DO ANYTHING SATURDAY NIGHT
We will discuss this with you
If I cannot answer the question then I will get an answer from our Ercot Rep
Let me know what you have
If I can assist with this accounting let me know
In the future I need to be aware of any decisions that will adversely affect me or my group
I do realize what a large undertaking this trip was
I would think not at this time
Lloyd is out of town until Monday so I am trying to follow up on his behalf
Johnny I just received this from Lloyd
I dont want to cause any double coverage by HR so you might want to check with Kim
Talk to Kim she is running with this now I think
Anyway I received the following question from some of our Retail folks
We look forward to meeting you
Are you a golfer
A & B escapes this expense allocation as they do not serve load
Can we schedule an interview with Keenon as I think that he is a strong prospect
JM Looks like we should be in attendance
I will be out all week
Use your judgement - let me know if you have questions
When in doubt wake me up
I will advise when it is safe to re-enter the water but for now EVERYBODY OUT OF THE POOL
If this situation happens we have to explain to Frontera why we didnt get selected by the ISO
Lloyd Do you want to answer George's questions or do you want me to handle this
Let me know when you have an opportunity
George I have requested your status from HR

Please let me know if this will workout for you
I can be reached by cell phone
I can meet with Keenon today or tomorrow
I will be out of the office Wed-Fri
Guys did we decide if we can interview this gentleman
I called Ercot and after some time they relayed that they were experiencing server problems
If this occurs again make sure that you reference this number
I will be out the remainder of the week on vacation
Let me know if this works
How does your schedule look tomorrow or Friday
George I have been out of the office on Ercot business since Thursday of last week
David we often trade with EPMI as they may be the best bid on any given day
If they'll never be EPMI transactions then we can remove that reference from the red sentence above
Which works better for you
If we started in September I would envision passing local charges congestion etc to EES
I look forward to working with you on this issue
Let me know when you wanna go
John I am available to play golf this Sunday if you are thinking about playing
Are we using this load now
I wanted to ensure everyone was aware of the current status
Please advise if you have any questions
Scott I dont get discounted tickets but occasionally someone will offer them for sale on the e-bulletin board
I'll keep an eye out for you
Kim Havent talked to you for awhile
Also dont we still have a rating system
Also is it possible for me to review my personel file
Lastly can you provide to me a copy of my contract
I can review the folder anytime this week
In answer to your question Kevin and/or Doug will be doing your review
Once you sign it it can not be altered
We should have it shortly
Do you have any problems with these confirmation formats
TECO asked us to scrub this down
Mikey Where are you
Lloyd Frontera needs a portal so that they may submit outage schedules for their plant
I want to go to this
This should get you flat for the day
Currently we are not trading
Shane Thanks for your inquiry
If you have additional questions please ask
I dont remember whether this gets trued up or not
Im sure it does
Deb and I think of you guys from time to time
I am looking for a new gig as well
We miss working with all of you guys
If there is an email list for Portland put together someone send it our way
Please forward this to anyone we might have missed
Mark Please see the attached resume that details my professional experience
Thanks for your interest
Do you have any questions about the resume that I sent
I can supply additional info or answer questions as necessary
I was also wondering what specifically LCRA was looking for
I have QSE experience and am familiar with Ercot billing
Addtionally I have some extremely capable co-workers that would be interested in talking with your firm
Let me know if we have something in common
I have attached my resume and if you could pass it on I would appreciate it
Thanks again and I'll be talking to you soon
Julie Please see my resume as attached
I would be able to meet Frank Busot and others this week or next at their convenience
Madhup I apologize for your situation given the strong performance and effort that I have witnessed from you
I expect to know my own status later this week
It doesnt take you long to respond to a slam
I have attached my resume which details my experience and capabilities
Frank Thanks for meeting with me yesterday
I'm sure we will be talking again soon
I get out of work very early each day as our trading opportunities are severely limited
Tell me what is happening with you
I think that Mike Eiben has been long gone from Enron
Let me know if you can go
Rob attached are my friend's resumes
The offers are starting to come in but I dont want to leave anything on the table
Need your advice so let's have that beer
Frank I spoke with Victoria Bender and Julie Gildea yesterday
Julie expects to send me some info today
I dont recall who his HR rep was
Mark Thanks for your reply concerning ancillary service procurement
Our position is that our custmers ie
Teco/Frontera should recover at least their O&M expenses for the capacity as they are standing by awaiting instruction
Cant - I have friends coming in from Calgary
We will have to go when I get free
John are you planning on playing any golf this weekend
If you fill this schedule reduce the purchase that is in the Portal and replace with the new source
They have told us to run the plant without question
We have asked them whether they mean OOME when we run
To a man the Ercot dispatch guys have said that OOMC means to run they want the power
They want to penalize us if we dont run and if we do we will lose money
If no resolution is reached I vote for ignoring their OOM instructions
Thank you Bill
We explained to them on numerous occasions that we dont believe OOMC means run
If they wanted us to run then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component
I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run yes or no
Here is my view OOMC does not mean run
Would this not be an omission that their view was incorrect
I think that this is a software issue not a protocol issue
If they dont comply we will shut down the unit
Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run
If you agree with me what is our next step
I need to move aggressively on this issue
Please update your phone list with Frontera's new numbers
They would prefer that we use the toll free number
AJ Thanks for checking in with me
I had a couple of questions Does Anadarko have any power plants or do they trade gas/electricity actively
I currently do several things I am the Manager of the real time Power Trading desk
I also manage the Ercot Asset book
I trade around a combined cycle gas plant in south Texas
I would be interested in continuing in this area
Thanks for anything you can tell me about working at Anadarko
I could send my resume but if we dont have paralell needs then I wont bother
I have some other things that I am working on
I have been consistenly profitable in my time here
Anyway thanks again and I look forward to hearing from you
The study guide just test you on the material
If you read the text and apply the principals that's all you'll need
As he points out it more about discipline and psychology
Let me know how you do trading
Sure I am online everyday
This is at my discretion
You wont necessarily be trading with me another counterparty can lift your offer or hit your bid
Let's trade it up
Are you all still showing numbers for intraday ERCOT swaps
If so when do you normally post them
Just talk to me when you get in tomorrow
No problem with EOL as we are trading it up
You need to add the US PWR Financial Swap to your EOL profile in my opinion
They were generating but our meter read was showing zero
I am not sure when the meter came back but it was ok when I came in this morning
Thus = we are caught in the middle
I asked my employees to clarify with Er= cot whether we were being asked to run yes or no
I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep Mark Patterson regarding th= is issue
I think that this is a softwar= e issue not a protocol issue
If they dont comply we will shut down = the unit
If you agree with me = what is our next step
I kind of lost my temper a bit with Mark
I will put in a call
If you could sell this for a decent price it would be a good thing
Thanks and lets trade it up
Also tell me the status of the Esca people
No documentation on how to use the system is available as far as I can tell
How far can we go back in a dispute
I thought we were somewhat limited
The contract was not specific concerning the intraday gas supply or how we would schedule intraday power
Otherwise they dont want to allow us intraday capability
When do you want to talk
I have Janet Wallis helping me address some of these issues
We may want to schedule a meeting to include her also
Let me know where we stand
So it would appear that we have a good case for recovering some money for OOME
Do you have time Tuesday
I need to start talks with Lonestar
Please check for your new Trid for your turret
Gerald I am talking with Gary Bryan
Come by when you get a chance
I really hope that they can complete these changes
In reference to Eterra I have prioritized some enhancements to the system that will improve its usage and accuracy
In addition I realize that we are working with time constraints and limited personnel
When it finds one then it should not overwrite this trade
This is one less step that we need to worry about
In addition it will allow us to quickly correct the portal if a mistake occurs
I met with Sasha today for approx
One less step that we need to worry about
Therefore we need to streamline the deal entry process and to make it more user friendly
I admit seeing a e-mail about the change of administrators but I didnt realize the website would be incapacitated
If you have questions give me a call
I will work to get this to you by tomorrow
Once again we have appreciated your patience during the transition period
Thats all I got I hope it helps
On the day ahead position that hourly would manage lets say it is in the short term ercot book
We need to change how we show a buy from frontera
I hope this is more specific
This is your position leave in North pool or sell as necessary
You did this for us in the old building but those changes didnt transfer
Mr Taylor I have attached my resume that explains what the heck I have been doing
Send me you resume if you wish
As I mentioned I will be out of the office visiting Ercot tomorrow
Once the upgrades are complete we need to restart the certification process with Ercot
We have been selling on a Real Time basis as much power as we can get out the door
Mikey - I heard that you have gotten married
Carmen Please note that my employee's correct name is Alex McElreath
Let me know what you need to do
Otherwise Ercot thinks they can OOM you up
When a heroic dog dies to save his master b
In fact even remembering your buddies birthday is optional
If a man's zipper is down that's his problem
For all other situations an almost imperceptible nod is all the conversation you need
The Resource Plan should reflect that we are available but offline
I will be out of town this weekend
Make sure that both are modified when you make sales/purchases
Know it learn it live it
Do you have Ken Parker's e-mail address
He needs to be copied on our preschedules
It seems that their software is not recognizing our bids
I have a couple of questions about OOMC capacity payments
Could you provide some help on this
I show negative new deal value for Teco Services when I sold above the curve on their behalf
The deal has been revised as it was to be a temporary placeholder anyway
I asked her yesterday to include you on the distribution
Clint Dean will step in for me
John - Don't forget to add me to your spreadsheet distribution
The jackass scam artist called them back bitching that they had cancelled their check
Just doing my job
The reasons you are asked to call varies
That's because you did actually make the call
If you complain both your local phone company and your long distance carrier will not want to get involved
Hello I am using MSN dial up through the Enron program
Who can I contact to resolve this issue
I also told Coleen the plant will be available if needed
I called the ISO and spoke with Jay about the OOMC
Can you please provide us with your MSN Member ID
I need his MSN Member ID in order to proceed
He said he signed up through the program
We must reflect our true minimums at all times
Steve indicated below that he talked to Ken at Frontera
Who are we notifying at Frontera
Please let me know if this does not happen
So basically they will be dragging significantly for these hours
Ercot will call and ask about our ACE issue
For example I give them gas prices and daily prices
I tell them that I will bookout my option
I communicate my feelings on the market very early
Clint has some other instances that he would like to relay
I dont really want to lose the job
We are providing some outstanding support in my opinion
The settlements extract as I learned on my trip is key to explainnig this value
Is there anything else from us that you would want
There are two considerations that I can think of
I have already informed IT of this issue
I will be out of the office next week so can you reply to Doug Gilbert-Smith
Larry I will be on vacation next week
TJ I will be on vacation next week
I will be checking in via cell phone
I saw the memo
Is there more that we need to discuss on this deal
I spoke with Clint--he's familiar with this situation
John--see Clint & myself on this
In this particular case she said we incurred the charge because we called again on it
TJ Could you tell me what my balance is for vacation days
Also I dont thi= nk that I have signed up for the floating holiday yet
I will be available via cell phone
This will make more sense once you inherit the position
Give them plenty of time to work this out
I think that Saturday morning will come in strong as we are getting some cooler weather
Lets trade it up
Is there a form I need to fill out for this
Q What has ECI done for me lately
A Forced me to get new business cards
Please use the internal resources available to you for these items
Thank you for your continued support and cooperation
I'm rambling but hopefully you get the jist
Can't make it
Did you attend the Market Affiliate presentation
If there only a few of you who have't attended I'll schedule the meeting accordingly
OK with me
If this is acceptable to everyone I will forward it to Toby for posting
I already did
The last I heard about it the deal had cratered
That catch all seems to me to include liquids
Generally an event isn't force majeure if it is purely economic
That's more or less what I expected
I'll talk to you all tomorrow
Upon our return on Tuesday each of the affected parties will need to discuss possible alternatives.
Does that have any financial consequences or other consequences for us
For example on TW certain force majeure situations can force us to refund demand charges right
If we did that Dave thinks BNSF would treat it as a declaration of war
So what do you guys think should happen next
Please reply and let me know what session you will attend
If you have any questions feel free to give me a call
I would refer him to our communications group under Shelly Corman
Sorry to leave you hanging for so long on this
In the meantime please do not hesitate to call if you have questions
If ECS breached its obligation it should take responsibility for its share of the consequences
Kevin should probably follow up with him on this
Randy this is the issue I left you the voice mail on
Do we have someone who is watching this out there
None of them did and most importantly the winning bidders did not
Please provide me your thoughts asap
Attached is my draft of a request for rehearing
Forgot to cc you
Lou do we have any sort of policy on requests like this
This particular chair is designed to help with back problems which she has
Leave word at the Downtwon Hyatt if you can join me
Great news about Frank wasn't it
But we heard nothing
Is that our story
I also found out that any time new furniture is ordered that these chairs are now standard issue
Please let me know if THIS DATE WORKS FOR YOU
Before going to the data room there are several issues we ought to think through
Steve is now in Omaha but when he returns let's get together as a group
I am satisfied the interim procedures are being followed
Questions -- let me know
To save Susan from trying to translate my weird scribbles I'm having Martha type up my vitriol
I'll circulate a revised draft to you all later today
Jeff Lorraine and I just learned that this is not the case
Please let me know whether you concur
I don't have a problem supporting the concept generally
No concerns--I think we ought to go
For your info- any concern with us attending
I'm afraid they come off as a bit too defensive
She knows the % capacity that ENA holds on our pipes
I know that you probably already read Jan's summary of comments
If you are interested here are INGAA's working papers
Otherwise I expect that we will have the opportunity to file a detailed reply after the conference
Amoco and Dynegy can't have it both ways
Can we argue this
If not I will...just let me know
Thanks for the report--glad it went over well
Steve--you or me
Its your call
If you have additional comments please let me know
Pls get me to Hou
I think it is a point that deserves mentioning to her
Just a couple of suggestions I would add any constructive feedback you have received from the clients
I would also suggest one more action item
I also attach my draft review form
Have we been subpoenaed
If not can we ignore this problem
I hope sending it to you is sufficient but if not let me know
I did not ask Mike what relief KN is requesting
It strikes me that such information may be highly sensitive
I will send copies to each of you
Under ordinary contract law we would probably have the right to terminate the contract if PG&E is in breach
I'll let you know how it goes
Let me know if you feel otherwise
In regard to Jerry's questions could you provide your opinion
Please review and advise your comments and/or direction
Also should we review our proposal with other Senior Management before responding
Let me know--my memory isn't helping me today
Marhta please print the stuff for me
Please print the report and memo and mark your changes
In the event you are responding for a group please indicate for whom you are responding
To Stan's Direct Reports Please provide me with your home phone number and a pager or cellular number
Please provide me this information via return e-mail
Thanking you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter
Can Danny revoke the policy just like Bill created it
On that logic we should want to keep ROFR capacity off the EBB until the right is waived
If its under contract we shouldn't falsely advertise it as available in my opinion
Elizabeth suggested that they talk to Susan Scott
Please advise your comments at your earliest conveniece
As the project progresses he will be contacting you
What would we be willing to settle for
Can you call Harris Wood and approach that subject with him
Let me know what you find out
Here is my list
Are we always required to use a lottery
I think all neg
I think there was another issue but I can't remember what it was
Thanks for your input on this
Please let me know whether you think this would be acceptable
I assume that there are no regulatory implications
Also when the deal closes I will notify you
Can you think of anyone else I need to notify
If you agree then I will proceed to get our Board of Directors' approval
Now I can't even get you to a meeting
I knew about the name a couple weeks ago
Were you involved
I really don't have any information so send you unless you want to see the organizational documents
What details do we have on this
Good to know that you have received wire transfer in time
Per your telephone request I have attached a file of the agreement
If you have any questions please advise
Obviously if we have already told them we're done working with them my threat won't carry much weight
Are you all OK with the threat
What you guys need is a real dirt lawyer
Don't we have any ex-EOG lawyers around
As to the RFP process I have even less of an idea
I feel awful about that--particularly since PGT did the same thing
You blew me off
Are you in town
I tried your phone but it's busy
Is it Enron Pipeline Company
Please let Bob and me know
I thought it had been moved already but apparently not
I don't know whether that's a concern for you
I would argue no since we don't look at the consideration paid for guarantees of other companies
I agree with Rod
I don't believe I have seen that anywhere but had heard that it was TW
I don't see any serious problems with this
Good thinking and good hustle on your part Craig as usual
The deal got done but not within our standard procedures
If anyone has additional questions I'll try and answer them
Due to the nature of the EOL deals I routed the request then approved on your behalf immediately thereafter
Should you have further questions please advise
We appreciate your patience in advance
The footnote issue scares me
If we just use the same footnotes as a matter of convenience we may have some flexibility
As I mentioned above that effort is underway
I'll have Martha coordinate with you guys
If you could list some specific points you think we ought to make that would be helpful
If the cost savings are worth a little bit of hassle we can do this
All Mavrix deals will need initials from legal--probably you Susan
For now please let me know of any deals Mavrix does with non-Enron pipes
That would be helpful so I can hear the thinking you guys went through
Denise pls print for me
Also we did not include a minimum time frame for response to bid solicitation because thought it unnecessarily limiting
Pls print this page for me as I can't
Shelley here is the filing I was talking about
Susan can you get Shelley a copy of my comments sent down today
I know everyone has been busy but please try to get comments to me next week
As you can see there are a couple of issues we probably need to discuss
Please let me know your comments and questions
Is he the man on Tioga now
Thanks for your work on this also Dan
Thanks Dan for being so prompt with my request
I am OK on selling these packages on EOL
I also assume that these will be short term deals--i.e. less than one year
If you have any questions call me
I have attached our most recent revisions to the Letter Agreement
I will be out of town Wednesday and Thursday returning Friday
Also we agree that our current practice will be to post only deals of less than one year
I guess that means that in the cert
I'm not sure that would be a bad thing but we need to think about it
How do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply
I haven't done any research yet so maybe these questions are easier than they currently seem to me
Mike Who should we be adding to the group looking at this stuff
Who would this be in your group
I left a message yesterday for Mary K regarding these same issues
Please go forward without me and I'll circle back in later
What the hell is going on with you
Jim--its been a long time since I bothered you
I look forward to talking with you
Per Grant I am sending you this last draft
When you gonna be up here on Monday
Let me know--I'll be at the office on Mon
I will send a copy to Patty
We can talk next week about our brief in opposition
Keep watching your back--you just became a bigger target
Sounds like you need to get a DOG
We are right back to where we started
Pls forward it to Kathy Ringblom in my group in Omaha
Please advise how you want to handle this
Please join me in congratulating Steve
Please let me know your comments by C.O.B
I do not expect the agreement to change significantly
The way I understand the suggestion we will always be able to change a slate if we need to
However if we take domestic annual elections out of the equation we can solve one problem area relatively easily
If there was that much demand you'd think they would have been able to extract a neg
We would be happy to have you here
Have some chicken soup and take it easy
I told her that our answer no
Kathy R have you seen any above-max index deals involving Sempra
Susan and Maria please make sure we get that done
Scott is having him call me then to discuss the answers
Scott was appreciative of the extension but frankly didn't sound like he planned to meet the Tuesday deadline anyway
In fact I'm not sure he cares all that much about meeting the new Wed deadline
Drew Here's a chance to wear your honorary Marketing beanie
As a KN operation it typically didn't run full
I'd appreciate your thoughts
I see this project being one of possibly two separate projects
Secondly we could build new pipe to TW/NNG
Let me know if you see anything troubling with the slides
If I do not hear from you I assume there are no issues
I think a simple checklist for the marketers legal & reg
Thanks for your attention to this request
I think the deadline got past us before we were ready
Did they bid on El Paso
Did I send him a letter
Do we need to schedule a follow-up meeting with them to talk about turbine availability and regulatory options etc
Tony and I will get with Susan for a summary
We'll let you know.
Wound up augered into snow up to my waist.
Bring your fishing gear in case the skiing sucks.
Definately bring your x-country gear.
My we sound a bit testy don't we
I agree-lets stay offline on possible deals
I got the call today
Shit--I knew I forgot something
Maybe we can run up to MPLS for a boondoggle
Or have you failed to even ask
When do you go
I got the call today.
A well deserved recognition of your contribution to the cause
What are your plans for replacing youself
Congratulation on you new assignment
If I can help in your transition please call
We will miss you here in Omaha
I'm sure you'll do a great job and hope you enjoy your expanded opportunities
We look forward to seeing you in Houston
Sandra--nice of them
We would also be available to show you around
Let me know when you will be in town
I didn't have a chance to really study the draft but it looked good to me
I can think of no better person for the job
See you soon Kim
We will welcome you to Houston with great fanfare
I have mixed emotions on your leaving Omaha
First let me provide some background on this deal
Are you on this mailing list
If so I'll stop bugging you
Please feel free to call Lance Schuler Hal Bertram or me if you have any questions
Well deserved I might add
It almost killed me
The format's a little screwed up but what do you expect from me
Well I've gotten myself into a fine kettle of fish
I don't think so but I'll let him make the call
If there are questions are conflicts of schedule please let me know
I'll look forward to seeing your smilin' face more frequently
If you don't hear from me by Monday ET&S is OK
Are we all on the same page that this is OK
Is MKM's group good on it
We are really excited to have you in Houston
Take care and good luck in your new job
Talk to you
It is just South of where we were last year.
I thought you might like their site.

Yes he did and i'm good with you starting full time down there next wk
Maria and I have talked about it also
I can't believe you will be moving to Houston
Please let him know I'll try to call her on Thur
I don't know what's involved but hopefully not much
Please review and provide comments to myself and/or Lisa Sutton
Drew I need to discuss this with you before I fill out the form
I guess the first form was broken
We are sorry for any inconvenience that you may have experienced
Once you have submitted your RSVP Form you should receive a confirmation e-mail

No need for all of us in one meeting
Great--Martha pls get me in here for next wk

I'm going down Sunday night--which flight are you on
I'm good with it but have one question
Here are my questions and comments
I have attached the document in both Word and WordPerfect
Drew Will you be moving to Houston soon
Thanks Bill--see my other email
We'll let them suggest a name
If so then that person could replace you
For your comments
Let me know when the call will be
You'll see that they are very general & policy oriented
I have taken a stab at filling in proposed answers
For your benefit I have attached below the general information that has been provided to stakeholders about the program
If any of you should have any questions please call me
We will have additional copies for you at the luncheon
Also please bring your list of identified Change Agents with you
If you cannot personally attend be certain to send an alternate
I gave him my number to call
Drew and I will sit in from here
With that clarification I think we ought to get this posted and the letters out to shippers
Susan--make it so
Do you do any of that stuff directly on SAP
I know that we can't control the way people think about issues such as market behavior price strategy etc
El Paso ''sets the price in California,'' Ms Lynch said and what it did was intentional
While Mr Clark said he did not know the return on that investment he acknowledged that it was lucrative
To its critics El Paso epitomizes the competitive concerns
Couldn't stand the suspense could you
If any of you have any questions please let me know
I will be at Derrick's meeting in San Anton
Congratulations Adam and welcome to ETS to both of you
Emily--sounds like it will happen soon
Linda -- Thank you for the update
I have removed Drew from the CMS routing system
If not we need a better system that allows me to get off lotus notes
I received some comments on the prior versions of these new sections but did not incorporate them
If your comments/concerns are not addressed in the new sections let me know
In the meantime you will notice that there are several incomplete cites or record references
We could use help completing these if you have the information
Dari Tony - if you have any problems approving let me know
Let me know if either of these is worth pursuing
Guys - anything we can do on the environmental side
I recommend that you focus on larger amounts
Please send your projections to Vera as soon as possible

Sorry I know I've disrupted this twice n ow
Should I just call Drew
Let's discuss if you think we might get somewhere with them
In case that is still a possibility let me pass on something we may want to follow up on
He didn't say but I suspect there is no warranty on the units
I'm not sure how/whether this works in a TW scenario but it might be worth looking at
Sounds good to me if its real

Early in January we will be in touch to check availability and schedule an initial meeting
In some cases we are many time zones apart and it will be difficult to match everyone's desired time
At that first meeting we will talk through expectations of us and of each other and the proposed goals
If you learn something tomorrow and can't get ahold of me please leave me a voice mail
Per our discussion at lunch excellent memo
Please join me in congratulating Kent on this achievement
I don't think I have this information
Are you on of this
I have yet to receive any such comments/updates
If there are no comments/updates please let me know
Please join me in congratulating our colleagues on their promotions
Congratulations Dari Maria Jim and Kathy and thank you for your motivation enthusiasm and consistently high quality work
Let me know if you think I really blew it

Here's one for you to chew on for awhile
Thanks for your responses
Any comments in the meantime -- let me know
If you would like to discuss we will be available early next week
Since you've reviewed it last nothing material has changed as you can see from the red-lined version
Pls let me know if you have any questions - thanks
Hope you are feeling better and that it is nothing serious
Didn't you get the Christmas card with pics
Then he dissapeared
Oh,...I got it
And a professional job it was too
If I come to Omaha I'll need more 'an pics
Find me a place where they got them
To our department unproductive time isn't a problem
What is a problem however is not knowing exactly what you are doing during your unproductive time
Thank you Accounting
Looks OK to me
I didn't remember that
If others are ok also go for it
Let me know your comments by Wednesday afternoon if possible
On the power plant I've got a couple of guys you need to talk to
When did you go out-house
I didn't realize that you had joined the pipelines
Can you give me a good contact at Transwestern
I suspect that the answer lies in Mary Kay Miller's or Julia White's areas or both
George sorry I disappeared for a few days
I look forward to talking to you
I'll call you shortly
We can start at any time just let us know
I will let you know when the other options are available
If you need any additional information please let Steve Linda or I know
As I understand the situation Plains and Tri-State have indicated their intent to close the merger
Also until the deal actually closes there is always a small chance it could come undone
I look forward to talking on Tuesday
No not that I know of
Tom are you the point guy for marketing the project
I shouldn't have joined the evil empire quite so fast
Siggy what are you going to do without Carol Lynn to fight with
As we discussed attached is the new list of proposed reference entities
Maybe he's my long lost granddad
Please notify me of your availability
If okay for all of you I will send out a confirmation and a dial-in phone number on Monday
Sounds reasonable to me
When do we sign
If he's not willing to be reasonable we're done talking to him
I told Dennis we would follow-up with him shortly
Sorry we couldn't make it yesterday
I've left a small glass candle on your desk
If you choose to light it over the holidays please think of the Dan Reedy family
Lou - Before I send these anywhere else please review and suggest changes
I volunteered your services and my own to assist with this work
Do you have something showing year to date
If you have any questions or concerns please advise
Glen was working with you on this I believe
I see no problem with this do you
When you open the excel file you will be asked whether you want to update linked information
Please let me know if you have any trouble printing and we can fax you a copy
I will forward Tony's as soon as it is completed
I think this is what Dot is looking for
I found the reference I was remembering over the weekend
The letter says they are a Hinshaw
This deal would seem to blow their Hinshaw exemption
If we can crack the Hinshaw issue this might be worth a shot
I may be overly optimistic but I also believe we meet all the Texas Eastern criteria
Thanks but I am in meetings today and can't make it
Did you still want to participate
Thanks for keeping me in the loop on this
Can we meet the pressure requirement
Emily please print this up for me with attachment
I'll stop by later to pick it up
However they have a continuing strategic appetite for LDC assets
They are/will be a registered Utility Holding Company so obviously PUHCA poses no concern for them
Got it and I've talked to Caren
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this requirement please do not hesitate to give me a call
Is this ours
I can get Tino comfortable without breaching our confid
I need to continue working the economics with James Centilli
I think its not bullet proof but certainly defensable
Lets do it
I see no basis for this limitation
Drew and I have discussed this and he is on board
Are we headed in the right direction
I didn't see you on the distribution please respond to Susan's question on timing
I've attached my draft again in case you need it
I tried sending it directly to the printer but couldn't tell if it went
Let me know if I can assist you in any way
Hey it worked great--I replicated several sets of messages without a problem
Then on Sunday I did something and now can't get the computer to load up windows
Please make it happy again and ship it back up
Martha is bringing it down
Let me know if you need me
Based on our preliminary information TW looks attractive as the supply source for the Wikieup project.
I'll try again and see if it recognizes you
Thats what we want Stuart to go and find out
Here is the email I got from George
Steve Kevin and Jeff If what I heard this morning is correct and the San Juan-Cal
USGT will not retain their ROFR rights for their contract
How far are you guys from the scareport
Unfortunately for PG&E toxins like chromium or PCBs in association with its gas pipelines can create their own dramas
If present they are carried in liquid droplets in the natural gas stream
In addition Kirsten Hand was instrumental in analyzing our information
We could not have done this project without them
Launch each document and print a copy for your reference
There is no need to call me or the hotel
Look forward to seeing you in San Antonio
Please check this out and get back to me asap
I hope everyone has a Merry Christmas
Sounds OK to me
I recommend TW do the same
If you haven't already requested books you may order these through Forms Management
Related to their downsizing
If we did what does the deal say
Re your comment on this today
Please give me a sign off if this is OK
If we need to develop our negotiating strategy before we meet with ESC on Wednesday please advise
On TW which has no fuel tracker in kind tax payment probably wouldn't help us
Given the numbers we got from Mark Baldwin is this where we are
I suspect this scenario is upside down
With optimistic assumptions like this does it make sense
I think either one of you guys with appropriate supervision would do a fine job
Did you try this on your laptop
Drew/Martha/Ann-- Please try this for me
How to add a name to your Personal Address Book

Please let me know your comments today
The question is can we do this
Will FERC let us build it
I'm sure I've left out important facts so I'll try to grab you tomorrow to discuss
I appreciate your input on this
His take on transmission constraints is consistent with what Kevin and I had suspected Alb
If we are not talking to him already he would be another guy worth talking to
Per discussions with Susan Scott I am on board with the original language routed on this contract
Sorry but I mentioned that you forged market based storage services for Market Hub Partners in your former life
Feel free to call her and Drew might also be a valuable if willing resource
Great--please let me know how it goes
If we do modify the strategy I'll also modify the talking points
I intend to call you after the Stan meeting to advise
This is not a big enough dollar issue for them to make a huge stink is it
Based on the above it seems that the decision to advise them we can't retier still stands
Alternatively we have given up more than this in the past to resolve their errors don't adjust
Mike I hadn't seen your email when we talked today
I have the phone number
Sorry we got cut off on the MOPS issue today
Thank you for any consideration you might extend me
I called and ragged around my thieving ins
Please see the attached and let me know your comments by Wednesday a.m if possible
Tell me how much
Is it ok to order him a printer
I may use it word for word
Thanks--I'll call him shortly and let you know how it goes
Who do you think Duke would send
I can't think of much else to say/ask
I will assume one copy is sufficient unless I hear otherwise
If anything interesting happens I'll let you know
Have your people call my people
I'll defer to your more expert addressees on this one
Please review and provide me with any comments or changes
If so I will prepare one
We don't know if it will be printed but it felt good to write it
I thought that was not so
I am faxing you the presentation
Shit all you needed to do all along was get rid of me and things started falling into place
I am troubled by your report
But frankly we are disappointed in the response that we have received to date
If you would like me to forward this memo to you again please let me know
Yea but what are they going to do with all that salt
This situation could worsen under Enron he believes
I want the full scoop
Did you know XA and Clark are gone on Friday
Didn't need Cook and I
More details when we visit in a few weeks
Following is one of the documents I got on Friday
I think Maria forwarded this already but you ought to make sure she got it
Pls print up a full copy for Mike and I
Sorry--I'm not able to do it Monday afternoon
I can see why you guys decided not to move
Note however their departure has not formally been announced internal or external yet
Great--please sign me up
Martha--I think my schedule is OK
Please let me know if I need to move anything
On behalf of Mike I am inviting you to accompany them on this trip
If so we might have a real conflict
Then I noticed who signed the pleading -- Jay Costan
I guess he ought to know as he is GISB general counsel
Will you be able to continue that in SAP
Shall I re-draft and recirculate the memo using the cashout approach
If that's the path you'd like us to follow I'll amend the draft memo accordingly
If there is anything on Mark's schedule consistent with those constraints please let me know
I'll visit with him again next week
As I stated after our last meeting Ray is very interested in performing the installation
I can oversee and purchase these items on my purchasing card
Please advise if you will or will not attend
I'm OK with the language but I want to make sure everyone is OK on the concept
Please review and let me know
Please comment and advise as you see fit
This is not something I believe we fully discussed
I believe we will be in control of the structure
Per my request please allow me sometime to digest this structure and consult with my colleagues
I will be in touch

If I hear more details I will forward to you
How long does it take to drive to Katy at noon
Why don't you make a tee time
I met with Ms Caplan yesterday and had a good discussion
I was pretty impressed with her
Have you thought about Steve Kean's group
Enjoyed shootin the shit with you as always
Lou I agree with your legal analysis
Would they go after PG&E and if so would that fall under or commitment to PG&E to cover costs
I wouldn't miss it
That would be great and solves the due diligence problem you and I talked about yesterday Kevin
Do we know anything about this
Please let me know as soon as possible your preferred date/time
I second that--thanks a lot
Again thank you
Kevin I still intend to hook you into the Votaw-DC call if you are available
I'll be in Houston so no need to dial me in
Drew Michael will call and conference you in as usual
Carmen--please print these up for me
He offered to do it in Houston probably late next week or the following week
Attending would be Dennis Tino and their outside lawyers Jim Slattery and Rick Harrington
If so should we have outside govt
Thanks for your patience on this project
I couldn't get the email through to Bill Gang so lets try William
Bill V if this doesn't show Bill G as an addressee please forward from your computer
Per our discussion last week this is the status on Pueblo
I also hope to meet with several of the Commissioners' assistants
Did you mean to leave Bill Gang off your distribution list
I have tried to hit the major themes but I am sure there are issues I might have missed
At which point we would immediately nom the SBA correct
Thanks for the heads up--I'll talk to him tomorrow
Let me know if you have any questions...Thanks
Lou please give me a call if you have any questions about this lady
Do you want to wait on the letter
Did you mention it in the meeting today
They nominate the SF to market services also in addition to any transport they have
Drew we are aware that you will be in Austin on Tuesday and may not be able to participate
Thanks in advance for marking your calendars
I agree with Susan
Please indicate your approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY
If they are behind I don't know who we should go to in the future
Maybe we need to run everything by corp tax from now on
I think I've already got things squared away with Jerry
Just in case I thought I would leave you this e:mail message as well
I will then notify Jan Jan and I will notify Sue Morgan Kent and yourself
Let me know if we need to change anything
Could you fill in any missing details
I would like Tim to participate in the discussion as well
Martha please print up and sign for me and send
I didn't want to raise expectations on that yet
Will it be in your office
Dari I'll dial you in
Kent--do you want to be involved
I'll let him know by cc
Thanks to you all for your careful work and patience
If that's all we need commercially I'm fine with it
Drew what do you think
This write-up made it back to me for my reveiw
Please give me a call after you review
This is what I plan to file today
I just found the numbers I was remembering on the conf
I don't expect that we'd want to disclose the swap value analysis in Steve's memo however
If Enron wants to do a deal in Albuquerque we should be selling capacity and reliability
Under those circumstances we might be able to cut them a break on power and provide reliability of supply
Great--Steve what's your phone no.
Tino lets add this to the list of issues we need to jointly think through
During his watch Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee was removed from his position amid charges of spying
Please let me have your suggestions
I got this from outside the company
While eternal flames are a great idea in concept they require vast and reliable fuel resources
They apparently forgot that we had created a second SBA
Nice to know how highly regarded we are in the industry
Hope your doing O.K
Tony I assume Lou briefed you on the situation
Now the issue is given dirty samples what can we do to keep PGE from slamming the interconnect shut
Will you get back with me as soon as you can
Here's the memo I mentioned
Obviously we have already used up all the good ideas and are down to the fall back plans
If the amount of capacity they have in bucket no
At minimum it focuses the attention on PG&E and not us
Please call if you would like to discuss further
Given the overwhelming response so far I think a meeting may be necessary to get this project moving
Please let me know one way or the other
As requested by Lou attached for your review is a presuit litigation analysis memo
Don't hesitate to call if you have further questions
I'm sure you guys are in the course of discussing these very issues but here's my two cents worth
If so how do we quantify that risk to allow a rational balancing of the pros and cons
As usual I'll try to stay on the sidelines and nod intelligently when you make a recommendation
I'll forward this to him as a reminder
ON the other two items I'll send you separate emails on each
There is obviously a distinction between their situation and ours
I just don't know what it is yet
Appreciate your responsiveness...and try a physician
As for the margarita idea I'm all over it
I don't know how far it is from any of our lines but it may be worth a chat
Our consultant's are reviewing the DOE data we
I''l let you
Drew I thought you would be interested in this research memo from our law clerk
Per your request I have attached a brief memo concerning capacity option exemptions and regulations
If the offer still stands I would like to attend this afternoon's meeting
If you have any further comments please let me know
Talk to you about this tomorrow
Great--please send me the current draft on Thur
AM for me to take a look at
I couldn't open it
Please call with any comments you may have
Any chance of getting together with both of you
I think this one is close to final depending on comments
Let me have any comments you have
I don't have any dates/times yet
I'll call George and get his thoughts
If you feel I've missed a function here that should be included please advise
Let me know your availability and/or the availability of your designee
Can we get a coffee/soft drink/snack set-up also
I look forward to meeting you and your client in person
Tell me where you want us to be
Thanks Leslie--I appreciate your efforts and being kept up to speed
I attended as the Enron person
There are other issues that affect TW not as directly but that you should be aware of
Let me know if you need anything have any thoughts or want to discuss
So what brings both of you down to Houston
Anything going on that I ought to know about
How did he do it
Tino this was easier than I thought
I wasn't sure which email to use so I used both
Let me know how your meeting goes
If you need to have the remainder of June and the first part of July input let me know
See you soon--beers are on me
I'll strongly encourage our guys to attend
Second we need to understand electric utilities as customers
Who should we be dealing with within the utility organization
What types of services do they need
And we hear a lot of comparisons between OASIS and pipeline EBBs
Sorry I neglected to forward this to you earlier
If SoCal is still feeling vindictive they can file an appeal in the D.C
In any event the pendency of an appeal would not affect the validity of our certificate
Can't make it unfortunately
What were his Impressions about the Recent Outreach Meetings
Did he hear anything new from any trade groups
What Does he expect to see in the upcoming RTO filings
I had just a few comments and typos set out in this redline
In any event I'll see you there
Missed you at the Bay-Bash on Friday
Did Frank Bay change his name
I hope its not a porno picture
Thanks Susan--I agree with your analysis of the tying issue
Christine--I'm OK with it
If not give me a call
Interesting and no significant deviations from what we discussed
Surely we've presented new services to customers before in advance of filing...if so how did we go about it
Are you OK with this filing from a general conceptual standpoint
In reviewing the proposed filing I had some questions
Seems like we need one even if its still very speculative
If you have any question please give me a call
ALSO I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE COLLECTING THESE CHARGES FROM ALL GROUPS AND WILL GET BACK TO US
Please send it as soon as possible
Reed you never called back you wimpy Pantani butt pirate
Let me know whether fishing is worth a shit out there
I even went to school for it
Let me know if you want any additional information
They'll send me the data if we need it
Tino attached is a spreadsheet with the info I think you need
Anyway when do you think the new IMacs will be out in stores
Sounds like we have plenty to do
Also on the site is a water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine
In the meantime if you have any questions regarding this project please let me know
Actually he's a democrat but such subtle distinctions escape me
I can't remember his name just now but he works for Cynthia Sandherr I think
Talk to Drew he might have an idea-- from his nazi friend
On the GCNM discounting issue it seems we need at least three data points to understand our risks a
From Lorraine's memo it seems that the issue of which route is best is half baked at best
Since we are going to sign and close same day we won't need adjustments for cap ex
I am putting together a draft PSA now
Please inform me of your golf handicap at your earliest convenience
I'm not sure I understand MKM's comment
Lets hope it doesn't come back to bite us assuming Drew and Susan sign off
Thank you for your comment please contact me if you need any additional feedback
OK with you
Please take a look at this and give me a call
I didn't know we were expecting any agreement from ECS
Please provide me with the right-of-way documentation to cover this pipeline
I would appreciate receiving this information as soon as possible
Huet I'll call you on the apple data tonight or tomorrow
Egg and Kate--I have nothing mean to say to you just now but I'll work on it
Mike talks to Hanover and we negotiate the price specific contract language etc
The Compression Services Agreement as it is currently drafted has a two part demand-commodity rate
Clever devils they are forcing us to determine exactly what it is that we own
I will have Janet call to determine your availability
Just curious but Courtney doesn't get any time value of money recognition on his prepayment
Also the prepayment gives us a cash but not earnings benefit right
I am forwarding per Mark's request
If everything looks good let me know and I will create executables
I think you said you have this covered but just in case here is the latest
I hope you can attend
Am I the only one having a deja vu experience
I'm OK with it thanks to some coaching from Jeff
Stan would like to request your home address and spouse name
Please respond to me via e-mail today if possible
No--that ought to do it
It look's like it will be VERY good
What do we do now

If you do not have comments please let me know so that I can make a note of it
I look forward to working with you both
Let me know if you have any questions modifications concerns etc
There are also some grammatical changes that I would make
If Drew Jim or Bob could let me know what time would be convenient I'll get it set up
Hopefully we can send the pleading out today but in no event later than tomorrow
Thanks again for inviting us to lunch yesterday
Here is my first draft on the bullets for Steve Winston Please comment asap
If you don't think I've explained this clearly enough let me know
I'll circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options and any other new ideas or questions
I realize there is some concern about showing them our filing
I still didn't see the kind of correlation I'd expect
I give up and am removing the arb argument from the daily imbalance section of the draft
Attached is my redline of your Sat
On the segmenting section I think it is a fine legal argument but it lacks something
If so we'd better be prepared to eat our words from the segmenting section
There are still some areas that we need to decide on
For example we need to determine if arbitrage argument works and finalize related Exhibits
Please review and provide me with comments early on Monday
Again this is a very special award at Enron and we sincerely thank you for your participation
Please give me your feedback/comments
Tony I agree it look s fine
Have you guys met/discussed this with Michele
Please get me up to speed
Mike--please give me a call re this
Don't think so--where was he before his current job
Have you ever met the fellow
Do you remember this issue
I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation with Mr Hertzberg
However it sounded to me like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best
He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders
That could be good or it could be bad
At the very least I hope he will show it to the Kinder Morgan lawyers
Christine I appreciate your explanation of how we developed the rate
Hopefully once FERC approves our purchase and sale of options we can price them as a stand alone service
For now including the optionality as a bundled component of the total discounted rate--as we did here--is appropriate
On the Tino front he apologized for not calling after their big DOE meeting
Bill or Kevin please forward this to Bill Gang--I couldn't get my computer to recognize his name
In case you haven't already marked your calendars tomorrow will be my two year anniversary with the company
Given your meteoric career tracks however I'm not sure you guys would view that as a huge accomplishment
Hope all goes well with you both
I think we're on pretty solid ground in each case
As mentioned below we won't be distrubuting these answers during the workshop
If you have any questions regarding this issue please let me know
I do not intend to distribute these answers in written form
Rather we'll answer them orally during the presentation and use your work product as a guideline for our answers
Thanks for your hard work here
Am I remembering correctly that this is for internal distribution only
Drew -- same goes for you
Give em hell in the deposition my friend
I love that # though I think they got a hec of a deal
Did you see what Duke paid for MHP
What were they smoking
I am eager to discuss this with you both
I'll call you when I know fer shure
Next time your in Houston lets get together
I have a lot to update you on
Or if you would prefer you now have the latest and can forward it to her yourself
The call is yours just let me know
In Mike's weekly report it was mentioned that you had a summary report on the document control project
Could I get a copy of that
Does this fit our understanding of the policies
For copies of contracts no retention period is required as I recall
Since you had outside counsel they will likely retain all the documents from the case itself
Unfortunately I think the answers are yes and yes
I don't know what she is even talking about
If so can you pls
I want to get Lee into this also
Drew thanks so much for your messages yesterday
John do we even allow TW people to use Pheasant Haven
Who do I need to call
Bay my wife says you can't come because your new kid is due around this time
Check with Steve and Lorraine re whether we should call their lawyer
I don't want to call FERC except as a last resort
Dick and I are in for Saturday and likely Sunday.
And no you cannot sleep with my dog
I have inquiries out to two other guys.
Let me know if you get short because I can scare up other prospects
Bay my wife says you can't come because your new kid is due around this time.
These customers of yours are the same ones that can't drive a jet ski without paramedics around right
And now you want them wandering around Nebraska heavily armed
What the hell are you thinking
Besides when I hunted there last we couldn't shoot hens
There are overnight quarters if we need them
I recommended to Dave N that we renew the membership
Once approved we would be happy to help set up outings
P.s. thanks for the offer on the duck lease--I may want to join you sometime
Drewski I'm not going to be able to make it
I call you this morning with the skinny
Please include Tony and I
Tony--pls cover for us
You and Tony are welcome to join us
We've had a similar request from Lee Ferrell which we would also expect to honor
Great--am forwarding to Dave for his thoughts
I'll talk to you when I get back
We agreed get back with them in two weeks
I have volunteered to create a new draft policy
I am also attaching the existing draft policy with my comments
I haven't sent it to him yet
My tiering thing will follow shortly for your review
Dari please take a look and let me know if you have any heartburn about deleting Par
It is in the standard form OBA but it is inconsistent with the new letter agreement
DF Drew I will send the agreement over shortly
I wanted you to review the following
I suggest inserting it as a new paragraph
As you'll see we are not advocating for specific regulatory changes in the presentation
I thought Becky's draft answer to protests looked great
I think so--Martha please get me into this gig
Lee if you and your staff would like to come please join in on the fun
I summarize some of the key information below
Please call to discuss at your convenience
I need your laptop and the following information,, RC# last four numbers of your SS and the company number
Hey--how the hell are you
Drew Do you get an off-duty report for your folks here in Houston
What were you thinking
Let me know if you have any changes
I'm not sure how to solve this yet but lets all put some thought into it
Let me know if this is it
Blockbuster is also moving beyond its storefronts
Am I the only one who doesn't understand this answer
I can't really reverse this year
I wrote off business development projects and some other things
At this point in time even if it happens higher we will still have a hole
Maybe they can try the structured products
Do you have any updates on that
I'll send the address - I checked it out
Should we try it
Congratulations on your new responsibilities
Frank received his B.S
Please join me in congratulating Frank on his new position
You guys are making us and our shareholders rich
Everyone else please give me your comments ASAP as Nancy has been asked to provide something to them tomorrow
Did the person who gave you the quotes explain that
Please let me know whatever we know about that deal--points term etc
If either or both of you guys are in Houston and free for lunch let me know
John great to hear that you are still doing the Lord's work on this case
The argument went reasonably well although the panel played it pretty close to the vest
Otherwise we will just have to wait for the decision
Tony give us a date and everyone please review the changes
Sorry we plan to meet on Weds
Per our conv. attached is form of master
Eric I think it would be good for you to join us for this meeting
I'm not sure that this subject is within your turf down there but your historical experience may be useful
If it isn't our responsibility whose is it
Julia for your group Rick or someone in his group would probably be best
MKM I'm not sure who is the best person from your group
To this meeting I mean
Dari have you seen any changes to the org
Are you shittin' me
Do we do this every quarter
Per Rod we will leave Gross O&M where it is and increase the overhead allocations
Did Rick fire you
Or does he work for you now
Or do you write in English American now
Linda brings a terrific background both in energy and financial services and is a welcome addition to our team
If I misunderstand the facts or if anyone disagrees with this approach lets talk about it
This looks good to me
Looks good to me wiht Tony's revision
Lee I did get your draft
Sorry I didn't get to it right away
I agree that Stuart should take a look
Will use my Mike Moran day
If the FERC deems it necessary they will interview individuals that report to them
I hope you make it in and get this Mon
We missed you
Attached is my first try at our motion to extend time
Pls give me a call
I don't see any immediate problem
You can select either of these dates to fit your schedule
Please feel free to contact me directly at Ext
Inevitably if you ask enough people the same question you may start getting different answers
Shelley--looks good to me
Since we spoke last night I have talked to Ted
We all come out the same way I think that this episode is probably best left alone
Perhaps we are more sensitive than most however knowing what we know
MidAm may have done that but we don't know

Seems pretty straightforward and we ought to be able to clarify this adequately in our answer to protests
I'll forward it to you both for review

Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated
Keeping discovery at bay should obviously continue to be a very high priority for us

Company name should be replaced by your business unit name
This works better if you do this in the View Master Slide Master area
The O&M/G&A graph should include your direct business unit expenses Corporate costs and other significant allocated costs
Stan only mentioned Rod and myself
You might ask him before I ask anyone else
I'll take care of it and keep you posted
I have to leave the office now
It will cost you
Are you free for lunch
Of course I do
Hopefully our relationship is stronger than that
I still love you
I am not sure if you still love me
I was a little confused after our conversation yesterday
Are you OK
Do you still love me
I believe it should be part of the allocation
Please get back to Morris for me
Was the request to travel made by Dave Odneal or yourself
Morris can you look at this for us
I appreciate Kyle's expertise and work but do we always pay the direct expenses for Corp assistance
I am afraid it will lead to alot more questions
I would prefer system average
The East market offers our shippers more flexibility
If you have any questions please call John Keiser Ext
I can't wait to see you tonight
I should be around until then
I have some errands I need to run at lunch
I can pick my things up then

Can I give it to you then
I also mentioned the intra day storage change to Dick Jenkins
I need to chat with Dick and Colleen about the storage
For now I will allow the intra day changes

Could you please supply me with this information
Please call if you have questions
Also I believe March is the last month CES is taking the gas from CES
Brian I'm tossing my copy let me know if you have questions

Charlie I would like to talk about the daily pricing if you get a chance
Hey you should see us up here

Kathy you might be able to do this too
Dan I think you will be hurting for Tetco capacity
I just never got around to requesting them

I have all the CNG contracts on the worksheet
I will be calling in the morining
Scott it looks recallable
I can't get my machine to print out the forms
Chris I am turning the Hunt Petroleum deals for the East desk over to Tricia Truong

Please forward me your passwords for the upcoming move
I should have sent this out this morning
All very good questions and NO we don't have an anwser
I may be inviting you to a chat on Thurs
I executed the Bug capacity for April
I couldn't find demand expense for this contract on the invoice
I sure did work hard on this didn't I
Joanne to the best of your recollection this gas did go to CES correct
When you get back let's look at your deal sheet and see if there are any notes
He was my contact on this
He does not show this deal in his records
I don't show it in my records either
I would like to see it if we do
I don't show any record of a deal like this
I have a supply but no market
I don't know if he is aware of this
Can you find out who they sold the gas to
Do you need this pathed and tracked and balanced
According to Dick Jenkins he agrees with the counterparty
Could it be booked under another pipe
Which one of you is it
I left a copy of the contract on Susan's desk
Susan you can toss this
Actually you could set the priorities for us
What should we work on first
And currently I am not working on the other gathering contracts
How do you suggest handling so the contract type rate schedule and firmness are consistent with the pipeline
I would change it to an IT gathering contract
Hey I just undid what I did because the deal already exist under ENA - Market East
Oh it hurts so bad
That's right its FREE
I owe you a popcorn small
Ahh my poor ankle
It's just about time for me to leave I think
I know you better
Do you really want to take that chance to fine out
Who can I start sending all these pricing questions to
What do I get if I break the chain
If I can provide any more info.to you please let me know
Please let me know and thanks in advance
That stuff will just make you fat
Lia please make sure these volumes show up on Texas Gas - let me know if you have questions
If you have subscribed to mailing lists please make sure to update your addresses there as well
Let me know if you want me to audit Sitara
I believe the Astro's play MIN
Actually my preference would be to have the contract released to ENA year round
Thanks again for your patience
As requested I will faxed February's bill to Robin
Thank you for your patience during this transition
Guess you got out of taking him out to eat again
I really do not want to give this crap to DAD
I think you should buy it
I have this information for you
It will be on your desk as you read this message
Would you take care of that please
I just entered it in the ces retail sheet
It looks like we nominated gas on this contract
She needs to think about it
I'm out tomorrow but I will call her
I need to buy back the gas CES is not taking
I will be out of the office Wed afternoon and all day Friday
I'm out tomorrow and if I win the Lotto tomorrow nite Mr Goodell will be a busy fellow
Did you go to scholl at a&m buddy
That's all good and well buy where is my Diet Coke
I hope that ties to your number
Thank you everyone for your patience
Oh my poor foot
Noone cares about me
I always have time for you
What time did you call
I didn't get any capacity either
Can you take the demand charge off of the deal
Can you please correct this
I updated the Transco rates and fuel for April
I will assume you de' man on this one
Please note I have not mentioned any of this to Stacey at NYPA
I had this filed in the wrong spot
I don't know if you ever got copies of the invoices
Everything given to me for you guys was actually wholesale stuff
I will make copies an send them to Brian
Brian what is your mailing address
What's your work number
That's probably better - because it is the Doyle Plant
I luv her
I'll be expecting you
Let me know what you see,
Ohh my poor ankle
Do you care
I now have all the deals
Who should I talk to
Which means what we bill CES will be different from what actually happens
I know this is what we did with BUG I just don't know how to do it
Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage
Should we release this to ENA
I guess we won't be having dinner for a while huh
The lecture is at the LLU office on Richmond close to Kirby I think
Oh yeah I may need to borrow a hacksaw if Dan Junek signs up
I'm involved because it may have been used to serve CES
COH should have the actual numbers late Friday but I have made a guesstimate below
Chris have you called CES to see how they're coming along with the schedule
I am referring to the values in Cols
Dick I don't have this deal in my records as a sale to CES
Also the contract has an evergreen provision but I don't think we should set it up that way
I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara
Give Aaron his gift
I'm busy washing my hair
I just know one of you wuz gonna ask me but SORRY i'm busy
Would you guys please give the latest CGAS number for CES
You know thats where you give the total volume delivered by day on ENA CALP and Dayton transport
Angie please send any CNG EBB postings pertaining to Appalachian production to John Jim Heidi Scott Dick and myself
Also when in doubt about the email send it anyway
That does not mean they agree to the pricing
I think Gloria is though
There is only a small chance that I will attend
You told me to set it up and I did
I may or may not be here
AND you are a good cook and you smell good too
I'm not sure what to tell him
If this is the case then the deals are not really ours and are presumably CES Retail
Back in January Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES Retail
John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron
If they stay with Enron then does CES realize this
Hey guys I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are TCO deals
Joanie - Do you have any insight into this
Please give me a call if you have an questions
If you have any questions or wish to discuss these please give me a call
I got it
I spoke with Brian at CES
Would you research this please
My William's ticket is yours
I hope things go well for you
I assume we schedule that
If you do outside deals this just changes the amount of storage that goes to Choice
Please forward to JoAnne Collins if you would I don't have her e address
So I take it you haven't received them
My contact Brian Perrone said he has not seen them
I will be out for the rest of the afternoon
I will try to touch base with you later today
I don't mention CES and I assume that's ok
If we receive consent from CEG/Nisource at some point in time I will let you know
Jeff - If I have misstated anything please let me know
How did it go
I think we are good to go
To my knowledge we have no Mountaineer
I have no contacts to buy from
I will be out this afternoon
Jeff I will include these deals on my manual billing worksheet to you

This was sent to me by my scheduler
Should we stop withdrawing

I will try to remind you
Let me know if anyone wants a copy of the letter
And if this is a valid deal we need to add it to Sitara
Could you please add this fee to the said sitara #

Chris we are not going to be able to repair this problem in the next few days
The bill itself is correct it's just on the wrong contract
Let me know if this is ok with you
Kate left us a bid form for NYSEG capacity
For CNG I would prefer to have the Cornwell space
Dick other than CES do you know what our CNG citygate positions are starting April
This is what I have
I remember chatting with deal clearing about it yesterday
Just a note we will probably be billed interest because the payment is late
To heck with gas mileage when you look so cool
I think either of the other vehicles are perfect

Can you verify what were billed in demand for Oct please
Here are a couple of demand charges I don't understand
I have not responed to any of these questions yet
I have a few questions about CES Retail's firm capacity
I am trying to determine what capacity CES had that was assigned to ENA with contract details
I combined a few spreadsheets but still have questions
Can you please assist
Make sure you copy her on any appalachian/local production issues
Please let me know what you know
Scott misspelled your name
I hope I have the right guy
I listed one of the CES issues down below
The other issue I have is pricing
I will try to get with you this afternoon
I wish I could write such sweet words
The demand and commodity invoice come in together I believe
I don't understand this one
Do you have a Sitara deal number
Send me an e-mail back to confirm
When will it go into the books
I discussed CES retail with Chris
Again those deals should be on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you
I'll e-mail that list to you separately
If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else please advise
I'm sorry I have not responded sooner
To my knowledge ENA has not done any imbalance trades
Do you have a contact at Statoil
I can call and try to get more info
It could be some CES thing we were not aware of
Gloria Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you
I instructed PSNC to contact Chris
I did this
Has Judy had her baby
Her due date is today so I was wondering
Joe it looks like we have already had some buy/sale activity
I'm not touching until you and I chat
I will talk to my counterpart this afternoon
I just plugged/fugged/guessed at the demand charge
When Dana does her voodoo stuff this deal will show up
If this is something you can get me to do let me know
Do you think Scott should go to this
I have corrected it in this version
Uhhh- you bet
Sherry you guys should see this after lunch
Sherry I don't remember who gave me this invoice
I will leave it on your desk
Please join me in congratulating Terry in her new role
Please include him with your queries
In turn we invoice them and they re-imburse us for that transport
If you have any questions or need additional information please let me know
I love Chic Fe Le
Good news even better when it happens
My contract at CES Brian Perrone just told me CES will pay the invoice we billed them
Last week he said he was working on their transport numbers
Also yesterday I informed Jeff about some transport CGAS had listed on the EBB
Most of these are the wrong people but they should be able to get you to the right person
You know guys who are cool with Enron and/or your name if I drop it
Not yet still trying to be creative in what I send
Why don't you email me with the info you need
I guess Ingrid is ok
That was my best investment ever
Are you doing okay
I LOVE MY SWEATS
Hey I have not heard from you in a while
Are you ok
Did you get you Boston Gas setup taken care of
FYI if you guys are interested
What have I heard - just a bunch of complaining
What is she thinking
I didn't even know Bob was out
You behave yourself
Have you heard anything from Judy
Also did you hear from Bob
Otherwise we could be liable for penalties
You probably don't eat pizza do you
Can I get a nymex plus offer
I wonder what's for lunch tomorrow
My techy's going to help me buy a computer
I have not registered yet
I corrected Sitara
That profile is for Natasha - not me
Do you really play piano
I'll send you the email that I send her
What's your wife's name
I'm going to mention you and your wife in my email
Did you ever chat with my buddy Ishi
Are you going to work for Enron
I will let you know if things change
Please let me know if there are any questions or problems
I'm working with Transco on it
Moreover we also want to maximize our daily withdrawals on the directly assigned storage services for the rest February
Please call me if you have questions etc
I knew we would have to address this eventually
Is there any way we can refuse this
At first I was thinking we would have to do this
Now I don't like the idea because it will be really messy in the summer
I don't have any of the contract information
Take a look at the worksheet and give me a call
Again for those LDCs where we participate in Choice programs we will continue to serve those customers
I'll keep you apprised as additional information becomes available
FYI not the markets I was hoping to see
Send her a digital picture and introduce yourself to her
I'll resend it though
Thanks and I'll give them a call this afternoon
Hey I'm coming by with a picture of Natasha for you
I think I'll change something in the system
Global Contracts can help you with touching and re-releasing the contracts
Then try it again and call me if you have questions
I believe this works
Here is what I bought
I think its just the demand charge
And you can leave me a voice message on my pager
I won't be going to my Dad's until Sunday morning returning on Monday
Mark I don't think I'm going to show this money on any of my worksheets
Do we need to let anyone else know
Hey how's my little boy doing
What does your Daddy do for a living
I do like to see the incremental stuff though
Please let me know k# when it is available
I just sent you and email
Feel free to mention my name to Ishi
Here is what I have so far
One of the floor tech's I chat with is Ishi Carter
I learned some things today
Ishi said it would be ok for you to call him
But I'm thinking I should at least know your name first
Also we have a ton of other IT type people in the company I'm going to chat with
I get you more scoop later
I would like to see when it gets here
It's not in the system but Meredith and I will take care of after I get the invoice
Please call me if any of you come accross it
Use Audrey as your contact now
Who has replace Jeff and what is their phone number
Hey I glance at that photo every now and then and all I can say is Huba Huba
Did you do the server bounce for me
I know nothing about Sonat
I sent a meter request to Faye Ellis
Ken told me you called
But I know better
I'll be calling him back later today
I'll keep you posted Chris
In addition Union Camp does not want to sign the agency agreement required by TCO because it is vague
I went home with every intention of coming back last nite
So what if I didn't
I'll bring a picture of her by your office tomorrow
I didn't actually write all this mushy stuff
Someone sent it to me
I'll take you both up for a ride
Stumpy and Martha agreed and up they go
He does all his tricks over again but still not a word
Jim asked me to forward this to you
There are two solutions that I see
That's up to you
After we receive gas daily settles we reload prices for any derived curves
I won't be in the office tomorrow
Please let me know how you sourced the gas
You called me to late yesterday
Here is how it works
I will follow up with the exact cost later
I believe you did a fixed priced deal with Craig Taylor
Could you get me the meter numbers
I also spoke with Marde @ EES
Thanks for calling me
Do you have any comments to add
I ran my TCO reports and it was not on there
I told her the price would have calculated last week
I spoke with Kate about it
Increase your Emporia volumes
Please advise of a contract number when it is available
I don't know if this meeting is still on
Advise the Commercial Desk and myself of place and time
How about we move it to ENA
Joany would you verify that thanks
Just wanted to make sure you received this
Because the forecast was lower I let Joann use the extra space for CES Enduser Market
Please tell me what you want me to do
I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES Retail
Please let me know the k# as soon as possible
I must have peace and quiet to focus on Transco
I'm sure I made a few typo's
I'm sure I made a few mistakes
Here's how you get there
I'm about to go get my Dad a chocolate malt
Today is his long day at the hospital
Do we dare start this again
I thought you were taking care of all that Tiger
She overheard Cindy Burnette working on Union Camp for me yesterday
We need someone from Enron to smooth this over with her
Or are you ignoring me again
This allows us to focus our efforts on current month
If necessary please forward to your teams
For example if you are correcting demand the fee type should be demand not commodity
Any exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close
I'm forgot what do you need at Tenn O&R for tomorrow
However we may move it to CGAS
Where will they see this in their p&l
I can't remember should the VNG demand charges be on I'm VNG or East and Market East
This looks like IT stuff to me
I think we chatted about this the other day
Hopefully we will know the first or second week in Feb
I wouldn't tell Steve its not a done deal yet
Just tell him we are still working things out
Where are we at in this process
Steve Stonestreet was asking me
What did we do about this
I'm thinking we let it flow
I bet you think I have been ignoring you right
I think it will be a busy day
Victor should we invite Joany
Do you mean an ENA sale to Keyspan
I guess you didn't know about it
Thank you Joann
Let me know if there are in problems
I'm at work where are you
I made a couple of changes
This worksheet will be your top priority for Friday
How are we accounting for that
I sure we are missing some things
I forgot about this deal
I missed you too
I hope it's basically accurate
Sorry it took so long
I believe this was the last email I sent out
Who do I talk to about this
Gary Darron I believe someone in your group should probably talk to Inez
Victor I did not put a meter number on the CGAS deal
Here are the buy/sells we did after lunch
I'm throwing away anything on my desk with Gatherco
Also if you ever need to send transport contracts to Houston its best to send it to Sylvia Campos
She is the transport contract Queen and she absolutly loves paper
So send her allllll of your paper
Before doing deals please check with me to ensure this capacity is still available
I bill CES Retail for the demand charges on this
Can you correct these
We need them done asap
Don't hate me for all these emails
I have not been ignoring you I'm just swamped with CES stuff
We will be talking soon I hope
I have a call in to Greg Synder at CNG
There's no way we lost this one
I believe this was suppossed to be a much bigger deal
Do they have the right to swing like that
Can you please give me the Sitara number on this deal
I just added the purchase deal on CGAS it was not in Sitara
However the contract is valid because Vickie is using it
I believe Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal
It was not on my wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese
Please email everyone with the end date when you find out
Do you know which deal I should put that on
Let me know if you need more information or copies or whatever
I have very little info on this deal
After I released the deal the pipeline contract and agency contract disappearred
Then I don't have an excuse for not doing my job
We know about this don't we Judith
A zone is not enough it must have a meter
I don't understand the location question the deal was set up like all other storage tickets
As far as I can tell ENA should not be billing CES for their storage gas
So we should show a purchase from CES for the storage gas
I still need the counterpart set up
Scott this is the deal we spoke about this morning
For January we will treat this as an exchange
I don't think CALP has assigned the contract to ENA
I had the buy/sale on CGLF
Have I seen the Explorer
I just get to work for a living
I don't get to enjoy life's pleasures
I would like to see it
Apparently you have to show up
If God meant us to touch our toes he would have put them further up our body
It makes the ice jump right out of my glass
Alfonso you are off the hook
Jeff we should probably chat about the pricing
I'll explain it to you when I get back
You know Jerry and I anin't Chowboys!@
I take that back the way I've been eating I probably am a Chowboy
I probably won't be able to go
Not as much as I thought
Attached is my demand charge worksheet for October
I think we can change the ranks pretty easily
For now this is all we need
Steve I am assuming all of the numbers shown below are citygate numbers
You're right Victor they are wonderful people
Victor Robert or I will send through some meter request next week
Linda would you see if you have a copy of the contracts from CES
Please let me know what I need to do
Looks like a match to me
I don't see a sale anywhere to FirstEnergy
Call or email me with any questions
I thought this was taken care of but maybe not
I am working with a backup that is confusing
I will follow up
I need a new pipeline set up
I missed these
Please path them in Unify
I agree you stay home
I think the CES and CEM agencies are set up
I know I need to set up IT contracts in Sitara
Pop's just called me

I don't understand the PA gas for Peco comments

Let me know if I need to do something
I appreciate your patience and apologize for the inconvenience
I still need to give you Peco volumes
I have listed my needs below for all but Peco
Did you guys execute the PSNC contract
I think Transco is done except for PSNC
I set up the S Jersey capacity - CEM

Please let me know if you need any additional info
What Chics will be there - and you don't count

For Boston Gas and S Ct we are told what to deliver and we will know that on Thursday
If you have any questions or problems please respond
Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN
If you have any questions please call Scott Goodell or myself
I don't think I have sent this to you yet
I think that's enough stuff for now
Thanks and will be sending you more soon
I broke them down individually for you on the attached spreadsheet
I bet everything we did in June July and August is wrong in Unify as well

Jerry I am going to be very busy with the scrap here at work
Most folk's base their cow/calf operations on a five year program/depreciation
Ma fell Saturday Night and busted her forehead
I think she required about seven stitches in her head
There were x-rays taken and her lungs are pretty much gone
Of course that depends on how well the x-ray tech can read his prints
Now where did they come up with a name like that
They removed the lymph glands from his neck
The doctor told him it was only fatty tissue
They took a pretty big chunk out of his chest
I guess that is about it
I'll be chatting with you guys
Oh I forgot the dang remote to the TV
I really was not for sure which one it was
I think I need it to program the darn thing
Keep your powder dry
IF Mary agrees they will prepare and addendum to the original agreement
I don't think we are using them anymore
Please contact me as soon as possible
Things are always crazy around you even when the rest of the world is sitting still

Maybe I should just keep this to myself
I'm so poor and I need so much

Please fax the support sent to you on this
I will contact Cindy Wernecke once I receive your fax
Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendations
In order to get their attention you have to turn them on
They are supposed to help you solve your problems but half the time they ARE the problem
No one but their creator understands their internal logic
Ernie this is what I think
I really need to get this resolved
I have some support that Cindy faxed me
What is your fax number and I'll send it to you
However it could have been done by CES or EES
I asked her to call me back
I'm not sure when I'll see him again
The following weekend Cindy is visiting me
It has been two weeks since I've seen him
We have a great time when we are together it just hasn't been very often latetly

She found out about it indirectly somehow
Don she will mail the other application to you at P.O
Love you MAN

Make it happen buddy - and remember I'm not made of money
I am glad to hear the both of you are o.k

I bet this is next to the Warick
I like the looks of this place.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any questions
Duke Energy Gas Transmission respects your online time and privacy

I will have a discussion with Dick Jenkins on Tuesday afternoon
I need a good idea what our needs are
According to Elizabeth we should not use the CES - StatOil Energy
I'm sure I left someone out
I need the following services set up on National Fuel
Believe me this all happened really fast
And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it
I do not have any deals set up in Sitara
I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first
I will keep track of the balances on an Excel worksheet
However we should always see what Martin can do with the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL
Let me know if you have any questons
John Chris I got the Palm V for each of you
I called Peoples Karen was out and Deana was swamped so I didn't ask her any questions

According to David Scott at New Power they did not make any adjustments to the bill
He said they may not have received all of the bill there might have been some Michcon activity missing
I can't change it
I'm not sure if it matters but it will make it easier to find I think
Or does it matter

Chris I am now officially in Power
I believe its in the deal correctly
Have you had a chance to look at this yet
Bruce asked me to e-mail our information to you
When billing please fax me a copy of your complete bill and also mail an original in the mail
Are you inviting your woman to this
I may need to extend an invitation to Ingrid
Why did you go to power
We don't have to call Transco when we change the volumes
Below are the observations that I have
I would like to get you feedback on these
In essence we see the supply management agreement being bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer
I want to keep this capacity separate and under our control
I will need your viewpoint on this
Bottom-line I want to avoid gas costs being inflated due to my inability to receive value for un-utilized capacity
I know you will need to review the contract
I will chat with Dick Jenkins about this after trading
Do you know if the additional reimbursement has been locked in
This affects our demand charges on CGAS
John can you fill in the missing details
Scott-- Here is your problem in getting these booked
You can do what you want but I still think we should book it
Should I let someone in your office know about that
In today's Gas Daily Northern Natural Gas has a help wanted ad - you probably aren't doing your job
I thought the meter numbers were different
Could you make sure he is covered for lunch please
If there is any problem with this please let me know
Did you get the fax of the Consumers Energy invoice
Hey you said I could delete this one
Please let me know if you need something else
Can you please help us out
I just spoke with CES
Please call me when you get a chance to discuss everything
I did not discuss the Equitrans gas with CES
I want to talk to Scott about that tomorrow
What are you going to do with the CPA
If not I wll contact Equitable
That isn't too big of a difference plus it is in our favor
Just got word from EES they can take the EOG gas
Should I have Scott Hendrickson try to sell it to Peoples
I am parked at Clay
BUT maybe Chris will offer since he probably parks at Allen...Chris should drive since I am paying
I just faxed the inventory list to Jerry
Don do you have a fax number I could send it too

Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke and lots of it
Always look in the oven before you turn it on
This was a deal we took over from CES wholesale
Here are the terms per the confirm Tractebel faxed us
Elizabeth faxed the confirm to me
I will gladly give this to David
TRADERS LOGBOOK Write it Down
We can use it as far as I'm concerned
I need to know WHY you all are still uncomfortable using the service p&l at least for demand charges
As soon as they are happy with it we are ready to use it
David-- Why are you still not comfortable using the service p&l at least for demand charges
What system resources are you talking about
If the only reason is that you're not sure which ones to do this is my suggestion
Obviously you need to confirm this with Dick and Scott but this seems to make sense to me
I will be out of the office Wed Thur and Friday of this week
Also have you received from CES the official in writing notification of their withdrawal from certain c&i markets
I want to make sure we have enough time to handle all the transportation contract issues etc
You know I gave you the wrong daily volume for the month of May
Please call me if you still have questions
Robert would you put these deals on the morning sheet please

I want to meet tomorrow regarding the CES storage deal
Doug I believe this invoice from Consumers should be paid by CES
I love my sweats
I need to explain this to Doug Kenny still
I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts
Which transport capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on
I think everything is OK now
So this reversal does somewhat surprise me
Does this sound correct to you
While these hoaxes do not infect systems they are still time consuming and costly to handle
I humbly accept my position
If you have any other questions about this conversation please let me know
I will try to monitor the deal volume
Scott when would you like to go over the CNG scoop
I think Alicia fixed this last week
Take a look and let me know

I don't know all the information on the local production yet
After she completes April she will recreate Jan - Mar
For pricing purposes I only care about total daily deliveries
Please look it over and let's talk
Are we required to do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months or can we dispense with this
If you disagree let's discuss
I will direct them to you as they arise
I don't know a thing but I think Mr Goodell is an expert
I can add a rate zone to match the pipe code

Molly will be working with me on all the CES deals
What happens if we sell CES spot gas
How do you feel about not sending CES a confirm
I don't think CES has transport on these pipelines
I should have February to you by next week some time
Also I can't remember when you said we would be getting Feburary
Because last time he made a decision about where to put a Cuban he was impeached
Mark I'm counting on you for this one
That is all I could get
Can you help with this Dayton issue
Just a reminder the GMS report I used from CES system only had volumes and no pricing

I don't have that many oats left anyway it could just be an oat
By the way Suzanne made a Second Baptist comment to me yesterday when I was talking to Robert
I finally figured out that her and Jim are very similar
Information is power that they can share with others even useless trivia information about friends
I don't think either one of them mean any harm they just can't keep their big mouths shut
Call me when you can it brightens my day and wakes me up
Suzanne left me a VM today
It would be her Kevin Bob Superdi and his wife and us
I should probably give her a response
It doesn't have to be this week I was just thinking about it

I guess you don't have pictures for me do you
I don't think the triggers are correct
I hope it works there
Tell Chris hi for me too
It takes them forever to do anything then they don't have the right people in the right places
Plus they are very let's say conservative instead of 'cheap'
Is my buddy Robert Allwein working with you
Still working it though
So far he has not received much positive feedback
If for no other reason from a negotiating perspective I believe we should go in with the lower number
Mark do you have a view on this
Call me when you get this please
Call me when you get a chance please
Why don't you stay home and wash your hair or something

Scott Profitt was looking for your phone number

I called to hassle you and you were not there
The lady from Mike's party called me today
She wants to show me a couple of houses
I have to keep working until you get here
Maybe after we go to the movie
I would leave early if I were you
I finished all but one
Guess what time I finished
Oh and we have until the end of today to finish them
Did you finish your reviews

Am I right
Even if the process seems like a waste of time you did your part
I feel so blah today

Would you be able to hook it up
Also do you have any info on your Arm's request
Mr Goodell told me you were the most wonderfull person in the world
OK with me what about Fred/Gayle
Please change it or unvalidate it and I will change it
What was I doing on niteline
Hey Scott is out of the office so I'm sending this to you
By the way I didn't know you were a STAR
I caught you on Nightline last night

Guess who the Goober was that paid it last year
I mean I don't have a stitch
That's ok - I mailed them a letter yesterday
I'm coming over after I work out today
I won't see you Friday or Saturday

Reply to this if you get it
They owe us the dough
Rerun the invoice and send it to me
I need to know ASAP
I need to get this out today
Dude this needs your blessing
What are your Trco volumes again
I can make changes now without writing new deal tickets
What am I going to do with my time
I still wish you would come up there with me at least part of the time
I updated the NYPA volumes for November
I put both tickets in the box next to Sandra's desk
Thank you Chris
I need you to please write a ticket a.s.a.p
I guess today is a bad day
If you have time today can we go over the basics
I just want to make sure you have it to sell
I'm looking for the following capacity let me know if you have it to sell
I mean look at the time and I'm still here
I'll get you the numbers by tomorrow afternoon maybe today
I know you told me that this capacity could be released
Plus I may be doing permanent releases too
Who is my contract for capacity release questions
I believe its Janice Felton but I will make sure
Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter
I will wait to hear from you
Is that something you could do for me
Hey I'm older than you therefore my life expectancy is less

You should call me so I can harass you
I get real tired of this guy
I don't need your lecture
Did you call in
I can't find anything in my notes
Can you guys help me with this
Chris Have you alerted the Settlements person handling New Power
New Power released the capacity volumetrically and I didn't catch it
If anyone says anything to me I'm gonna deny it
I've been thinking about you
Mr Singer said you were looking at houses
I'm starting to think you don't care about me anymore
Frank I was out last week and I'm just now getting to you email

Makes me want to race
I believe the fuel consumption will be tolerable as well
Now Debbie wants it
I have to pick up old gray over at Jerry's
Debbie said it is going to be hard on me to sale my old dodge truck
I said Yep had that truck longer than I have had most of my women
I really need to engage brain before articulating

I may want to put some steers or heifers up there
I am going up soon and having the tractor fixed

I will have my cell phone
I also plan on taking Monday off

Let me know if we can keep it.
This information will allow us to negotiate in an informed manner
I appreciate your assistance with this effort
AND I TELL HER THIS ABOUT ONCE A WEEK
Please forward her to me in the future
If you could please let me know who will follow-up I would appreciate it
Just wanted to say a quick congratulations on your new addition
I do not have Sitara access
Let me know if this is an issue
What's your Intellectual Type
How do you compare to others
Your privacy is extremely important to us
You have taken your discretionary holiday
I just found it
Do you have the April CNR invoice file
I don't need the big producer allocation statements just the invoices showing all the demand parking and variable cost
Let me know if you want to see the producer information
Would you call Jackie at Cinergy please
I gave David the upstream information
Actually I need all of them because I can't tell what these items are for
I have the gas Sales Invoice List Report that you just gave Phil I think
I have a problem keeping my cell phone battery charged up
But my pager still works so I'm wearing it if you guys need me
Mike I'm faxing you official statements from the pipeline and I'm going to mail them to Theresa Vos
Who bills us for these charges
The name sounds familiar but I don't know this guy
Good luck and let me know how it turns out
If you would be interested in giving to a gift basket or flowers for Melissa please let me know
I do expect it to come down some
It just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey
He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him
Then to everyone's amazement he quieted down
A few shovel loads later the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw
With every shovel of dirt that hit his back the donkey was doing something amazing
He would shake it off and take a step up
Now the Moral of the Story Life is going to shovel dirt on you all kinds of dirt
Each of our troubles is a stepping stone
Shake it off and take a step up
Free your heart from hatred
Free your mind from worries
Moral When you try to cover your ass it always comes back to get you
But I'm going to try and keep it down to minimum
Per Pam the person we should be talking to is Pete Koikos
Could you get me the inside ferc's for May please
I schedule a little gas on Lone Star
Germany Chris says you mite be rite about that
Germany Chris says but we will see
Germany Chris says so are you going to stay way up North
Driscoll-Ernest Marde L says are you in the retention pool
Germany Chris says You will for sure don't know about mine though
We look forward to proceeding with our rollout early next week
That's a far cry from what Enron claimed at its peak
If you have any problems please let me know and I will get our outside counsel involved again
Please add Robin Barbe to your distribution
Robin I glance at Phil's worksheet everyday since I generate most of the cash payments in our group
Do you think the replacement price makes sense
I have a faxed copy but the numbers are difficult to read on it
Otherwise maybe you could just send me a spreadsheet with the numbers on there
Let me know if you need further information from me
To my knowledge that capacity is still valid
Ruth I had asked George Linder
He never did anything with it
I adjusted the deal in sitara
Robin confirmed that we did receive the payment from CMS
Also Robin Barbe will be my backup when I'm out
Ed this is what we discussed
I just briefly told Ed what you and I discussed
I'll keep my notes of our conversation anyway
Harry I think we finally have everything done on our side
I don't see you on MSN
Do you know anything about these contracts
To the extent that you can define roughly the shape of this deal I would appreciate it
Let's talk about this Tuesday when you free up
If you agree I will inform the plant
Is this something that we should continue to get
Call me ASAP please
You know I have a baby on the way
I bet you guys miss me too calling up asking dumb questions falling off horses at the shipper meeting
How's life for you
Good I hope
Just checking to see if you are still at Enron
Who did you talk to
Two changes for me
Please review your phone numbers in the attached Group Contact List
Here it is again just in case
Would help if I included Theresa
OK Kathy and Troy have pointed out how bad my previous email was
I'm sure I was thinking about lunch
I will be doing the scheduling until further notice
Kathy Kelly will be my backup when I'm out
Theresa looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions
Kay Barbara please let me know which one of you is working on this deal
I will be emailing an addendum shortly
I don't have their document in electronic form but I hope that you do
I also just got off the phone with Ivy at Iroquois she is the capacity release lady
OK that's it
Boy I really am looking at this calendar wrong
I don't know him
I will fax you the invoices
So it is still not invoiced
What did we actually invoice them for in total
Jackie just wanted to let you know that there is some work on the pipeline in May
NOW THAT's WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR
This puts us in a bit of a bind
Priscilla do we know who at Enron will pay the Goods and Services Tax
Is it the correct amount
Priscilla please bring me the wire request and I will get Ed and Susan to sign off on it
Stephen Drew who should I give the wire too and where are you located
I've also attached a copy of their tariff
I didn't know
Why wouldn't that be you instead
Kevin is my hero
Kevin I wonder if that bigger volume is a gigajoule thing
This guy is going to be my boss someday
I hope we still have someone who can do that
Do you ever talk to Bob
What is he doing
I want to call and hassle him at home
I wonder if that bigger volume is a gigajoule thing
I am starting to path it up right now I have a question regarding the volume
The lady that I wanted to attend was out today
Sorry for the head fake - my bad
The direction is good with me
Thanks for your leadership on this one
Not a big deal but as a result I want to catch you up with where things are
Let's visit on this when you get a moment
Finally I need you to tell me if you are OK with how this thing is shaping up
As soon as that is done and I am notified we can get the invoice out to MidAmerican
Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please
Do you know the answer to the tax question or at least who to ask
Didn't mean to hit send it just yet
The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible
Kay the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada
What kind of new car should I buy
Remember I can only see numeric messages
I can fax these to you
By all these court delays TCO has actually made us some money
I will have to get this nailed down Monday morning
I will have to check on Monday what exactly was done
I will have to get more info from EES on Monday
Once again EES continues to use and pay the invoices for its contracts since the petition date
I do not know if written notices were sent to ENA
I can't pick up any e-mail from home right now
She shouldn't need anything but if she does please help her
Let me know if that's ok
What specifically is she going to do
Let me know if you have any comments / concerns
You understand the needs of those for whom you are responsible
On the negative side you may be manipulative close-minded and sentimentally rigid
Interestingly your preference is just as applicable in today's corporate kingdoms
I am a White Knight
I bet you are a Benevolent Ruler
You are the anonymous philanthropist who shares your wealth your time and your life with others
To give is its own reward and as a White Knight you seek no other
On the positive side you are merciful sympathetic helpful giving and heroic
On the negative side you may be impulsively decisive sentimental and misdirected
Just faxed them
I am doing the noms on this one
I don't know if this has been resolved
I'm moving my cash payment to Reliant to Friday
I had the time of my life
Please forward to anyone I may have missed
See you guys there
I just spoke with Theresa Vos
Sabra do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and Williams is giving us the gas at
The scheduler over there calls me every morning to verify
Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne
Sabra Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future
But I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should
I'm going to try and meet her today
Sabra are you handling this
If you are do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify
Now I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee
I gave Maria a copy of everything I'm mailing to you
By the way I did the math on Sabra
I love taking Fridays off
Let me know what you want to sell for tomorrow
I thought it might be enron photos at first
If it ever happens on the weekend Jim and I will discuss the pricing the following Monday
If I remember correctly Midland would call Kevin and Kevin would call Reliant
Are we sill set up that way
Somebody around here must know what they are for
I'm out tomorrow and Kathy Kelly will be backing me up

Don't forget about me
Someday you are going to want me working over there
I hope I have the right email address
Judy gave me these names of people that were cut
My fault I didn't see the Wed
I admit it I'm worthless
So you guys could probably meet without me
When can I cover the baby under my insurance
I believe she said that if we provide them with pipeline support from Tallahassee they will adjust our bill
There are two adjustments that will be made to their invoice
Don't forget my State of Florida adjustments
Hope you are feeling ok
Let me know if there's anything else I can do
Don't lie to me
I guess we will find out when we get the invoice
Have you pathed this yet
I think it needs to be pathed in Unify
Would you path this
Just take you best shot on how to do it
Don't know if that's it or not
Thought this was interesting...check it out
Not that it's true...but its nice to speculate

Steve I need your telephone and fax number
This will cause you to have one of those arguments
Would you work on that
You and I can chat about that later
But I still need a backup for the gas activity
It looks like Cornerstone Propane L.P has not paid their December invoice for physical or financial
MidAmerica is probably holding payment for forward value I don't know about Cornerstone
Both had invoices sent to them for December sales
Call me if you need any further information
The priority should be based on your judgment
Let me know what you want to do at this point
If we took the gas I assume that we did

He or she would not be eligible for severance
What is our Dominion status
Should we continue updating Sitara for transport items
Can you help me respond to Volume Management
Do you have a particular way you'd like these dollars handled
These are all the people I have been working with lately
We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination is wrongful unless Mark disagrees
If you are not the intended recipient you must not read use or disseminate the information
I have beed in contact with him and he is familiar with the issues
It might be too late but I can check
Let's ask Kathy she will know
This was just in case you had the same question

I am requesting the following prepays to Reliant and Dominion
Let me know if you have any questions concerning this
Ill do the best I can
Max I forgot all about you needing this
This is what I have done so far
If I need to send these to someone else just let me know

BUT you may already be doing that
I prepay Dominion for the supply each month
He will fax a letter to me
Kay I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair
Should we meet here

I mean Susan
I assume you are talking about Susan Pereira
Hey do you mind if I send her an email with all the stuff attached
Lia already called me and I contacted the guy at Shell
Say hi to everyone for me
Not much of a lead but hope it can help
You feel that only by control controlling your innermost thoughts are you able to maintain your air of superiority
Don't date or hook yourself up with a hussy
Just remember no woman deserves you and they should all thank their lucky stars that you even ackknowledge them
Daniel these are the notes I took from Friday's floor meeting
At the end of this process the remaining employees as is true with me will be let go
Hold on to your integrity respect yourself and each other and remember what a team we have had
Inside of this room you will find your wife sitting in a chair
I could never shoot my wife
Then the man came out with tears in his eyes
Finally it was the woman's turn
She was given the same instructions to kill her husband
Don't mess with them
Chris I propose we meet/talk with Kathryn before noon tomorrow
Will you be able to do to that
I think you will be happy with me
And I have another question who at Enron should be receiving invoices
Could you please tell me

I can't believe it
I use this board about twice a month
According to Iroq the problem is on our side
It should ask me for my ID and password
Greg We've chatted before but you may not remember me
Again I thank each of you for your contribution
My name is Bryan DeLuca and I am with the Application Integration Team

So far its been the highlight of this week as well
You need to meet us again for HH
I will remember you in my prayers

PwC and Weil probably need to be informed of your efforts
In my opinion we should terminate the pools as early as possible
Do we still need to speak with Iris
Kay who should I work with at Weil
Jeff Loretta are you the right contacts for me at PwC
I spoke with Steve Stonestreet at Columbia Gas
He will do a conference call with us tomorrow
I told him it would probably be around our lunch time
I can set up a time tomorrow
Hey I think you are the only person that doesn't delete this right away
That's what I plan to do
She wouldn't tell me the current balance
But I believe we need to address the LDC tariff issues along with the pipeline issues
I believe it was just one customer
How is this customer currently getting its gas
Is the contract active or how/when did EES dispose of it
Please take away my access
I think this job has my name all over it
I would normally send this request directly to settlements
However it is my understanding that all request should be coordinated through you due to our circumstance
I hope everybody has had a great week
I wanted you to be aware of that
I really do appreciate and understand everybody's upset
We provided to them more data
I'll keep you posted on progress
And it works its way through the review approval and communication process
I'd like your input on that
I thought it was a great idea and very generous
Hopefully I'll be able to meet many of you there
Other than that I don't have a lot to report
I want to thank everybody for their efforts all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward
Thanks so much for all your hard work your efforts your dedication
I hope you have a great weekend

We are forwarding them to you for your information
I just can't make it back
If you've been moved to a cubicle you probably won't last long
Cooper knows his employees have been hurt financially and emotionally
It's the hardest part of his job
You can't change it
And he has opened up lines of communication

Except for the fart against Colorado you just don't bet against the Aggies at Kyle Field
But I think more importantly they are just playing great football
But regardless you've got to admire Stoops and the job he has done
And as far as the Horns are concerned I still think they are just an above average team
But right now I think the Aggies have a better team
But if they start thinking about aTM they will lose to both Tech and KU
Crazy things happen in College Station I wish I were out of the country on that day
Right now the Aggies look like they could beat us
We better get our shit together
Again I hope I'm wrong but the Aggies worry me

The universal compensation for buddies who help you move is beer
If a buddy is outnumbered outmanned or too drunk to fight you must jump into the fight
If you compliment a guy on his six-pack you better be referring to his beer
In all other situations a nod is all the conversation you need
If a buddy is already singing along to a song in the car you may not join him...too gay
Before allowing a drunken friend to cheat on his girl you must attempt one intervention
Do you have any xtras for the above referenced
If that is not worth fighting for then what in your opinion is

And I am not talking about losing a war but our freedom
I hope everyone is doing well
Please add any changes you want
I appreciate your time and opinion
This outline is a guideline to help you
Irena Please print the attached file on Enron letterhead and give it to Carole

I am also a Police Officer for the Memphis Police Department
Save your passengers your crew and your aircraft
In an emergency you will revert to that training
When the fanatics made demands their training told them to comply as best they could
But I bet they did as they were trained to do.
The crew members on that flight didn't worry about Flight Attendants they didn't worry about passengers
Very few of us have had to confront true evil
But when the Captain left the F/O and S/O thinking the situation was under control he was mistaken
I mention this for your consideration
Today we are at war
So how do you do that
What weapons are available to us as pilots
Command that they come forward and help you kill your attackers
And they will come
The airplane itself
Get the hijackers off their feet
Go into an immediate dive to float them to the ceiling
If your maneuvers have the hijackers on the floor writhing in pain crush their skulls
Drive it into an attacker's eye ear throat or into the area just under the jaw bone
It will at least impress his buddies
Make it public
Then everyone will bring them
None of us is immune
Best of luck to you and may God Bless

Rob she could talk to Barbara Gray about a position as a paralegal
Not enough experience for our shop
Louise I can take care of this
Once in a while I need to get my hands dirty
I have reviewed the CA and only have one comment
Cynthia Rick Grove and I talked by phone to Chairman Rainer today about energy
Also I pointed out that innovation has been slowed for electronic trading of energy by the current regulatory structure
He appears to be strongly against us
Why do you think that is

Global eCommerce will help you stay ahead of the curve
I received the binder
I've had limited conversation with him
Prior to this he worked for several US brokerage houses
I get the sense he has known Michael Hutchison for a long long time
He started his career with A Strauss & Co a metal exchange broker and tin merchant

Please pass it on as appropriate
C Robert Paul general counsel for the CFTC had concerns of his own about the legislation
In a currency swap the two exchange currencies and re-exchange them at maturity at the same rate
In the meantime they exchange interest payments
They allow banks for example to match their assets and liabilities much more closely
Importantly for swap spreads one reason that firms are borrowing so much is to buy back their shares
The yield on their debt rose sharply
Since they are the biggest actors in the swaps market so did swap spreads
But James Bianco who runs an eponymous research firm thinks they are not
I would try Rick Shapiro
As you know Clinton should sign over the next couple of days legislation on electronic signatures
I think the RFP looks great
Also should we encourage joint bids
Do you disagree with this conclusion
Lance it looks fine to me with exception of the reference to Kinneman
Please look at this and give me your comments
I want this lawyer to help Wayne
I think this will take care of the issue
I'll forward over any other information I can find

Should I try to make a trip to Washington in September
Let's talk about this when you get a chance
Hence there is no effective credit control left to trading participants over whom they should do deals with
In my view
If the Exchange does realise the collateral however it will hold it for the benefit of all Participants
If you require further details on this please refer to Tina Ward in Tax Department
May be your traders should look into this in greater detail should it be of concern
Please e-mail your additions to Janette for her to compile
I was happy to do it
I really like your artwork
In fact I will be showing them all on Saturday
I asked for a list of major energy trading parties
I meant to copy you on this but sent it before thinking
I hope this is of some help

Let me know what response you are getting
There has been no meeting for some time as you know
My thinking is that we should first hold it in London
I would split out Community Affiliations or just delete it
If yes please send again without the note to me
I think Enron is more likely to use the intranet service
If the cost gets too high I don't think members will pay for it
I look forward to getting together

I hope this is of help
I wonder whether you could help on the following point
Please let me know what time will be convenient for you
Please send an e-mail copy of the speech I gave shortly after meeting with Mr Ford

Ontario's electricity sector was failing us
The monopoly we had come to rely on for safe reliable and competitively-priced electricity was no longer working
As government we bear a responsibility to ensure the opening is done right for all involved
Ontario already has sufficient supply to meet our current needs
Thirdly we will protect our environment
And fourth we will encourage new ways of doing business and support the search for alternative sources of power
Giving them choice will help promote the demand for cleaner greener electricity
We will do it and we have put the principles in place to ensure that we do it right
Look forward to it

Would you request this person again Y/N
I will be in San Antonio but available by phone

I always find these large multiple party regulatory proceedings to be difficult ones to assess from a conflicts standpoint
Please join me for a baseball game

I would think we can do the same as we do in Florida which is similar to your suggestion

I don't believe we've received a single one yet. and Stan wanted me to remind everyone
It will take more specifics before it is done dates and measureable objectives but it is a start
Thanks to Jim there is a longer list than I might have started with
It will take some actual doing on our side to make this happen but it can be done
Jim Saunders What do you know about the other comments

Do you have any insights on this
Do you have the same for the income side
John Morris can't make this time and he needs to be in it

I have initialed the Consent for your execution

I am just now leaving the office I hope
I will follow up with JPMorgan and SSB but I will need your help on the internal piece

Did I miss something
Need to get her and Jerry on board as well
I will attempt to answer some of Heather's questions as well
I have the following questions Should the note receivable from parent be classified as current
Would you be able to draw down additional debt
Attached is a copy for you
Unless you can think of a reason why not it makes it simpler I think
It's your call but you should make the call on whether or not we will integrate it into Enron
Being open Adam and I have different views on the direction of the organization
While we are both professionals this situation does create a conflict
I'll continue to work with Rod but would be glad to discuss with you in further detail
Both are worthy of serious consideration and both capable of meeting your needs
Initially he was in Enron International
I know that Causey also thinks highly of Andrew
PS - I am always open to buying lunch
When do we review with el paso
My recommendation is that based on the current situation we retain the aircraft
I have also sent your assistants this e-mail
Can you guys take care of this part
Any help you can give is greatly appreciated
Barry suggested I try to reach you with this question
On the other deal they are back to total capital expenditures and not just expansion dollars
So Operations should not count it
You along with our banks have been invited to attend this event
We look forward to your attendance
We will need a DASH to get his signature on
We do but this can be very company specific on exactly how people define it

Drew is correct but we can tell them where we want the money wired
Pls confirm and I'll let her know
None that I am aware
I will contact you tomorrow with more details

Got me to thinking how are you guys doing
Where are you in the cash management world
I know you were tight before is the situation any better
I was wondering where you saw the process standing
I believe the Koch deal on the subs expires at year end but I'm not sure
When you get a chance will you let me know what the update is
The operative word is it has been put on hold
Give us a few days to figure everything out
Thanks for your cooperation which I desperately need right now
I asked about smaller more practical changes to fit more people on the floor
Not before you scheduled the meeting
Only as a result of it
I heard its been canceled
Here is my stab at answering certain questions
Why did Enron sell its stake in EOTT
I have EOTT to address these two questions
Sounds like they have a deal already
What do you think we should focus on for the crew
You keep one and give one to your neighbor
The government takes one and gives it to your neighbor
The government seizes both and provides you with milk
The government seizes both and sells you the milk
You go on strike because you want three cows
You count them and learn you have five cows
You worship them
Rod Rod Here is the memo I mentioned in the Shared Employees Agreement e-mail
Thanks for your support in this endeavor
Once we determine= the new dates I'll forward an email to the team
Could you see where this stands
Are you aware of where this is coming from
I'll pass that on when he responds

Thanks for getting back to me on these
Regarding the operational storage gas purchase I did receive an e:mail back from Stan approving the November purchases
Have you talked to Somerholder
I think we should manage for cash in these interesting times
If you need it go ahead and tell Dan to pull the trigger
I will tell Stan
Instead we got Stan's approval of the purchase by e-mail
Fyi Got you
I have a request AA has asked if we can repay the notes to the pipes,
They may want to discuss with you
I will let you know as soon as I know
I view the sale of a note as policy
I assume they are focusing on Enron's credit quality
I thought since you called about this I'd send you the list
If so it is way to big just to cover our needs
The Enron Health Center has received its shipment of flu vaccine
Are you aware of any
I will get back to you
Please let me know if this could potentially work
Thank you and hope to meet with you soon
I recommend approval of these

Work with management EH&S Pipeline Safety and HR to understand their needs and develop effective system solutions
I am ready to conclude this offer and fill this vacancy
I am OK as long as the budget dollars are available to do it
Rod I believe and support what Shirley Jo is proposing here
If you approve we will proceed
If not we will develop another strategy
Do you fully support these positions
Why do we want to pull this work away from EEOS
We may have to due to Market Affiliate issues but do you have other reasons
I have two positions I would like to fill
If it was this week the answer would probably be no
In light of the recent events can we still attend the event at the Kayenta Boys & Girls Club
Sounds like this is not the case so I am OK Looks like we will need some further explanation
Joe please respond to Rod and carbon me
While this person will have an IT background they will not be performing IT work perse
Here it is it is not yet in final form
I am little touchy right now about how to approach people so we need to be careful
I am open to more discussion on this just would like to soften the tone a litlle
What do you think -- overkill
Of course if one of us is unavailable feel free to contact the other
Let me talk to Stan when he gets back to town
Lou and I need to discuss with him and we are a little occupied with the credit agreement stuff
What do you think of this
Please take a look and give me your comments
Can you help us here
I would think not but wanted to check
We need your help ASAP
Can you have some appropriate individual confirm this for us
Bob Chandler said you were looking into the ownership structure questions
I think it would be OK but you might want to check with Stan
Something for us to talk about during our next staff meeting
The sa= me could go for SECLP and Gaza
He'll be taking only his telephone and personal belongings with him
All we have to get out tonight is the info books
Let's review the letter term sheet diagram and CAs tomorrow morning and send them up by e-mail
It's probably too late now but we really do need to watch our spending for awhile
She listed Johnny McGee her Director for notification e-mail
I need approval to have a telephone installed for her
Are you still going to be making a presentation
It may simply I just haven't had time to look
If we do this we need to have both an internal group and an external group
Does this make us feel better
I think I feel better but I would like some comfort from the lawyer in the crew
We're there given his response
Won't be able to make it
But he should now about already as he supports Phil
Yes Amelia sent us a note early this morning
Are you coming to it
Anything I can do for you don't hesitate to call
I really don't know but he will
FYI we received the signed copy from Williams today on MOPS
I'm going to ask Arnold to indicate that it is our normal review process unless you guys disagree
You must take care of them but the government takes all the milk
I trust that makes some semblance of sense
If you have additional questions please call
I will submit that that may be the case today
Nevertheless= I want to be able to move forward if there is no alternative
Do we have this info somewhere
I'm about to return to the office to see it
I have a call into Nora
Of course if one of us is unavailable feel free to call the other
How about sending it out from me
There would be no purpose in giving him E&F data
Do you know how that what kind of data if any the pipelines will be giving to him
As such they have the ability
Bob gave me the subscription agreement this morning
Is this somewhere in the merger agreement that we could see
I know this is something Roger and Rod discussed
Per you request Also make sure that Jeff Sommers added his name to his list
I am not aware of the EEOS situation currently Keith Marlow has been out of town
When can we count on the dividend
If necessary I can go
I will need to be in Houston on Wednesday am
FYI I believe Rod is on board with this
I'll try to e-mail the job= description to you today
But do not r= elease until I give the go ahead
No because they are in networks
Should I include Mike Sullivan's group as part of Global Accounting
All if no comments are received today we will assume okay to file
Do we want to tighten these up somewhat
Please email approval for you and Stan
Currently we have no employees in any of these new groups
Sounds interesting and I haven't heard anyone else talk about it
Do you know the answers
Rod - do you know the answer to the question below
Also how should we handle the politics of taking this responsibility aware from Karen
I believe the footnotes probably cover it but to the extent you have more it would be helpful
I am at the lake
Are you sure I don't need to be there
Based on our prior experience we understand the process of gathering and processing data may be time consuming
I look forward to working with you and your team
That is one of the things we are working on
The price they paid recognized the debt was there if it is not there the price will be higher
I am leaving the lake
Give me a call and we can discuss further
Hope you guys are doing fine
Sure was good talking to you this am
I should be back in te office on wednesday
Can you please review and get back to Tim
Tim Attached are updates I mentioned yesterday
Where do you want to meet to walk over there
Do you want to eat lunch somewhere before
It is poss= ible they will ask for additional information
Meetings h= ave been set with Dr Boyce to discuss his interest in the Guam project
I willnot be able to attend
Where do you want to meet to go over there
Is it far
No at least not to my knowledge
If you need asignature fax it to the hotel
Do you know anything
If you have not been asked you may want to start thinking about it
I had heard something similar
Thanks very much for the update keep me posted
As you can see not everybody is always on board
The issue is is it doable
What is your choice
I'm on my way back there to do so
Do you have any op= inion on this Bryan
Please correc= t me if I am wrong here Tim
If it's not a test in the lenders package then it is not in the deal
His reply was that Jerry should check with you
Sounds like Mr Cordes is seeking your insight
Based upon this please let us know your final thoughts
Not needed unless Bill Cordes has asked him to attend
In which case let me know because we are monitoring the attendance list closely
If so I will schedule Jerry for a later flight departure from Houston that day
Please let us know your thoughts at your earliest convenience
It's their asset now
Ok I asked gary to have you decide on Michael
I told Gary you could make the call
Let me as well as others know the outcome
If you have any questions please don't hesitate to respond
Since we are no longer using Maverix that guarantee can be done away with
I would confirm Jerry's comments
And we just have to get over the hurdles here
When you get back we can talk more about it
Before we can sell the units need to be registered
I agree cash is cash
Can you help us out here from what you know
I do not believe you can loan money to Enron
Have you filed to be able to make the special dividend
Just forget about it the company will not be reimbursing for attendance this year
If you approve please forward to Rod Hayslett for his approval as well
I agree with Morris
Let me know if you need any further detail
If you are in agreement how should we proceed from here
MN is finally accepting our money
The same to you and yours
Dear Mr Hayslett We wish you a safe and joyful Thanksgiving
I have forwarded to Stan and agree with your perspective
ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers not more
I guess I need some more definition
If I am creating a new group and I have nobody in it this doesn't make sense
Can I get some definitions to go over this with Stan
I'll call about it on Monday when I'm back
Do you have this data
I have it - I will get it to her
Did you understand that
However it would be better if we could cut back on providing specific data
Do you see any way to do this
As we discussed JPMorgan would like to hear your views on the above issues
I will give it some thought
This is what I am trying to reach you about
Call me if you have questions or changes
I haven't heard back from Steve at all
Do you have anumber for him
Ok with me
I will let you know then
I am available if you wish to discuss
I thought I sent a copy via interoffice mail I will send another copy
Does this even apply to me
Did you send it
We will keep you posted on new additionas if they occur
John will email to me tomorrow his due diligence requests
In addition to commercial items he would also like to cover operations and regulatory items
Drew not sure who we need on the regulatory side
What do you think about Tracy and Jim
Per your request historical California throughput data for TW and competitive pipelines
Please advise me only if you are unable to attend
What would you like me to do
James Richardson asked me to forward to you
Can this be moved if not you will have to have it without me
Can you attend this one for me
Sounds like a reasonable deal to me
Please call Kathy Campos to get on my calendar
You can try but now you are talking about getting into parts of contracts
I am working on formatting the information you provided
I also want to ask you some questions regarding the segregation of existing Gallup and Red Rock
Michael What do you know about this one
So I am trying again
You can use my office but I may not be here
I could probably do by phone and may be here
I didn't know if you planned on being here or not
We could patch you in by phone
I have been in discussions with them as well and I don't think they have that flexibility
Who has actually been working on the move for you
Okay we will plan to relocate them
Attached is our detailed due diligence request list for Northern Natural
Is there any update on your negotiations with Standard Chartered
I have interviewed one internal and two external candidates
I will circle back with everyone later today
Do you have anyone from Accounting
But if we do not have plans to build by year-end it probably should go to Corp vacant
ROD do you agree
What do you think Pam
To my knowledge that is still the case
I looked at all my rent corrections submitted and it isn't one of mine
Could you please advise what rooms this correction covers
If you want to see the model let me know
Kevin you may also want to attend
I hope to have an answer shortly
Can you answer his questions
Rod if you support this I suggest that you and Keith review this with Stan to get his approval
I have not really been involved in the evaluation but will be happy to attend
I will need someone to cover EEOS can you do that or should Keith
We are getting it
Steve Can we speed this up
Do either one of you have this
I called him
Next time ask Jim to call me
Thought you might want to cover with them
I just spoke with Jayshree
Do we know what we need
I will be out of the office tomorrow
I meant to try and explain not to redo
I will likely not be available
I just told kathy to send an email tomy direct reports
Tell everyone to calm down and get their work done
Then they should go home
I know it doesn't help much but I'm not sure what you can tell everyone at this point
Isn't that about the way it could happen
Are we still waitning on some info here
If I could get something as simple as Lost Time vehicle accidents or such I would appreciate it
I may not be able to make it
Don't count on me
Where do you intend to have that meeting
Thinking about the current organization do think it appropriate to consider putting Ms Fischer in his organization
His group will be providing services to all but I am willing to carve out some priorities
This is considered a critical meeting for your attendance
First of all why can't we do a deal with Northern Plain's a wholly owned subsidiary
At this point Wes will be there unless you prefer not
Not as far as I know
Has it been a conscience decision to withhold Sally's PAA
We don't need you yet but I'll page you when we do
This may be a disclosue event for us
I've spoken with some of them and they just won't budge
I think as long as Enron is performing I'm not sure why there is all of this noise
I have already approved and forwarded
Additionally we discussed some sites that would provide a variety of things to see
Below is a possible schedule he sent me
I just wanted to make sure you were aware of this
Should you have any concerns please let me know
Send out under your name as final
Note they are under separate tabs
I was afraid of that
However our cost center would only incur the costs for four people
Would we have the funds for that
I assume each cost center i.e
I am not sure what the overall costs would be but I can do a budget if you want
And we will give you something stating or reaffirming our deal if that is deemed to be necessary
I guess my concern is what good will it do anyone
I am not very comfortable with that at all
I do not think we need a letter though
Just in case you have not seen this
Thanks for your help and let me know of any issues
If they have not we need to get them produced ASAP
Also lets see what type of support they typically provide to AA for their quarterly financial reveiws
Bob - can you call Saunders and fill him in
If I have missed any critical steps that you can think of please let me know
I am trying to get a decision but I think we need to maintain flexibility if at all possible
I understand now
In the end I think Fernley saw the problem too
I didn't realize there was a choice
Please let me know your opinion on this
Let me know if you have a name otherwise I'll call Rex
Boy I'm REALLY mad at you
I have not gotten it signed
When I was ready to do so Belden was unreachable
Then I suddenly forgot prior to rushing down to H-town
What do you want me to do now
Are you really mad
Please advise on how I can try and do damage control
I have never received the signature pages for the Allegheny ISDA
Have you sent them
Would you have a copy
I can't help this time
The only Enron Corp guaranty we have was issued in connection with financial transactions only
Sorry I thought maybe you were a mind reader
Attached are the forms I mentioned
Let me know if they have any questions
I believe all deals going forward
Am I right Max
Also who will be the party signing the guaranty and when can we expect to receive the signed guaranty
Again thank you for your assistance on this
Thank you for sending your comments to the guaranty
Please note our comments below
The rest of your comments are acceptable to us
Can you prepare this guaranty for Pat Leahy
Also are you signing a master agreement or a short form confirmation
I don't know if we can get this guaranty on such short notice but we'll try
But don't worry about this if it would slow things down
Could you please arrange for a guarantee from Enron Corp
How long does it take
If you need any clarification please feel free to call David Minns or me at any time
As soon as we have it signed I will send you a fax and the hard copy will follow
Are you still going to revise the credit
Please let me know your exception time
I think I received this e-mail in error
I am in the Legal-financial trading group
I know that Nick is working on something like this
Please could you provide your view on whether we are expected to provide sign offs for the methodology
When we get them signed I'll distribute copies
Got the Torch assignments you sent down
Please let me know if this presents a problem
The one that changed its name is a Colorado corporation
Let me know if this is confusing
I am unable to find anything to substantiate this information
Here it is at long last
Please don't beat me
If I see we won't get them to you this week I'll let you know
The ISDA is being faxed to you now
I just left you a voice mail re the termination
So is it true that the underlying new deals do not become effective until the assignments are signed
Please let me know if you require any further information
Thanks Marie I have no issues with this letter
Okay with me
I have checked and Temps are available
I do not show that we have a file for Lonestar
She was going to revise the termination and bring it to me but I haven't gotten it yet
She said she would revise the confirm
If it does not then we are in real trouble
Thanks for all your help Marie
Where were you yesterday
Are you going to initial this before you go to London
The Bear Stearns agreement you see listed is there in error
You should have received a fax from me by now
Have you not received it
Yea and it needs to stop right now
Marie We're pumping out worksheets down here today aren't we
Yes we will sign enough originals of all documents so that all parties can have an original
Hopefully we can get this wrapped up tomorrow as I will be out of the office Friday
One more question - I received some of these in duplicate and some of them were original only
Do you want to attend
Marie My plea is for it to be next week
Are you available then
I am available anytime tomorrow afternoon or Friday afternoon
You didn't think you would away today without another e-mail from me did you
When they're ready if you'll call me I'll send a clerk down to get them
So far I am open for the next few days
Do you have a fax/phone number for Eric Twombly
Typically it references a transaction which in this case there are no transactions yet
What is your opinion regarding this
Marie Have we received an opinion from Glendale
If it references our ISDA and all transactions it should be fine
When you return I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions
I'll send you an invoice
I am not sure if the decorative center is open today - if so do you want to go
I did the comparison and gave it to Mary to review
Has credit ever responded to you
This has sound to it
Dianne S We will conference you in
We have a scheduling conflict with our conference rooms
Anyway everyone was needing copies of the closing documents and they were all over me for them
She hadn't organized and conformed the exhibits to her specifications
Any word on where we stand on this master agreement
Where do we stand on Allegheny
No you can do power
I'd think we could do the latter as that's what you had to do for me
Are you aware that this occurred
Ere you successful in scheduling a meeting on this/ If so when and where will it be
If so will you provide me with a current list
But why he's plodding through it is beyond me
Obviously he hadn't even reviewed the draft
I'll let you know if I hear of anything
Let me know if you hear of anything
Please advise should you require any additional information
I think this is yours
Hi Marie Can you confirm that this would cover Power transactions
Can you assist me in getting them signed
I am routing the documents for signature now
Will fax them to you when si= gned
I had no interaction with her so can't comment
Would you request this person again
Attached is a form of Enron Corp guaranty that we are required to deliver in connection with a confirmation
I have prepared and am attaching such certificate
I am finalizing the documentation for Jeff's signature now
Please prepare the confirm and forward to the financial confirms group with a copy to me
Do you want me to just drop by your office then
Or do you need it now
If so will you send me an original of each for my files
Also will you know the amount of shipping etc
Again thanks so much for your help
We really appreciate it
I will then firnd out pricing for you
I do not anticipate any problems getting the account open
Maybe we can have lunch early next week
Just let me know if either works for you
Attached are AES's comments to our draft ISDA
If you have any questions or concerns please direct those to Tom Spencer
If you believe that it has been sent to you in error do not read it
Then delete it
No you can send them all together
Thanks for your further assistance on this
I will chase those today
I can do that if that's your preference
Let me know please
I can't get it signed until you initial
Credit is not throwing you off
Have you seen it or are they throwing me off
We look forward to hearing your comments
As you can see below I just replied to Mark instead of forwarding to you
Hope all is well with you all
Please contact me with any questions or comments
I don't know who Debbie Nicholls is either
I don't know anything about Debbie Nicholls

Please let me know if you have heard from anyone
I will forward copies of the documentation to you
I wish I could but I have a paralegal lunch today
Can you join us
Hope you are enjoying your time off
Do you have an account there or was I mistaken
They sell his fabrics there
We really appreciate your help
Do you want us to pay in advance
I am working this noon time on your orders
Also my husband may want me to add taxes - because I am using his tax resale certificate
I am checking with him and will let you know
Do you want me to go ahead and place the orders
My goal is to have it done by Friday
Well I guess that's why they get to have such nice pretty stores
Once I place the orders I'll know the exact amount including freight
So I'll let you know
Isn't it a big scam that these stores have
Do we have a conflict
Glad you enjoyed them
Maybe that's what they are working on
I think we are in big trouble
Do you hear any scoop
That makes sense since we have that SEC inquiry going on
I think Lance is working on some of the law suits
He has some securities law reporters in his office
We appreciate all Credit does for us
We appreciate it
Did I send this to you already
Marie Could you check on the status of this for us
Oh my gosh
I'll resend it
If the attached drafts are acceptable please let me know and I'll process for execution
We have our own form of corporate resolutions
Can you send it to me again or tell me where I can find the documents
If the directive changes before the meeting tomorrow we will advise everyone
I don't remember there being a project name
This is the guaranty I spoke with Clement about
It is our standard guaranty except that it is multiparty/multiproduct
I thought we were handling just like ENA
Did you ever discuss with Cynthia or Molly
Please send Imad and me the updated confirmation for execution tomorrow
Please contact Imad if you have any additional questions
What are we going to do
Those structuring people can't possibly be nicer than us
I guess I wish you well although it's going to be bad for us
Oh as far as the HUGE Happy Hour I hope you aren't getting your hopes up too high
Seriously we will miss you and I wish you all the best

What documentation sets forth your investment objectives restrictions etc
Also do you have any comments to the forms of guaranty agreements attached to the ISDA
Thank you very much for the drafts
I believe we are almost there
In any case I don't think we need this definition
I think that may be it
The attachment is your Overseas Securities Lending Agreement
Do you want me to just walk down to your office
Molly Sandy and I went to City Hall & Library at lunch
I see Enron has some
I guess it would help if I attached the documents
Would you try again
I didn't have anything for her so I can't complete the review form
If the attached revisions are acceptable we should be in a position to finalize execution documents
Did your lawyer have any comments to the guaranty forms
I think it's OK to just refer to the LLC Agreement
Let me know what you think is best
Attached for your review are clean and blacklined copies of your form of assignment which note our comments
Please let me know if the attached changes are acceptable
Can you let Banu know the status of the CA

Pursuant to company policy the agreements must be initialed by a lawyer before they can be executed
I'll call you before I leave

I finally remembered to send this to you
I don't remember if I forwarded this on or not
I think it will be okay for them to sign
Additionally our notice information will need to be completed
Robbi do you know
We can cross that bridge once it is fully executed
Do you have to send them an executable version
I don't blame you
To tell you the truth Marie I'm not sure I want her doing any more of my stuff
I guess there's no credit
Can I get a Deemed ISDA template from one of you
I'm working on the guarantees now so I should have the draft to a lawyer today

Marie Left you a voicemail concerning this
It appears to be in order so I am in the process of preparing it for execution by us
We can confirm transactions with them under this Master Agreement
Once ENA has executed the document I will send the general e-mail to everyone as usual
Have you had a chance to review their comments
I am attaching a revised list
I forgot to show EBS not that is has created a significant amount of work
In fact we kindly reject them
Will you gladly look at these four too
I thought you would enjoy these
I just received these from Niagra Mohawk
I need to make some changes to them
I don't have any exceptions
Thanks for your voicemail regarding CT Corporation
Again thank you for your assistance and attention to this matter
Mark Taylor said I should forward this to you for review
If this is not the case please let me know
Legal can you please have a lawyer review the attached draft
This is the first financial diesel swap we have done
Let us know of any adjustments
Francisco asked me to send you the revised guaranty form
You don't believe everything Tana tells you do you
Haven't you realized she's just trying to get out of work
Through my conversations with Tana I understand that there is a change in the Confidentiality Agreement
Thus I am sending this information to all of you
Would one of you please help me out with this one
Attached for your further handling is the referenced CA
If the enclosed meets with your approval please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no
I will then have it executed by Enron
Maybe now we won't go through as much paper as before
We may need to run these by Mark Taylor for approval as he approves the trading resolutions
Thank you for all your hard work
Did you need any additional info on these counterparties
Let me know if you need help with anything else
I will touch base with them
Hopefully we can wrap this up soon
We have no place to get insistent given the amount of time it took us to compile our remarks
Our Credit Department did not provide us with a cap for the Enron Corp guaranty
Can you provide me with the date for Deal No
Thought I'd e-mail you rather than call and interrupt you
Kristina managed to get her digs in but fortunately Mark saw right through them
If your offer's still good we would like your assistance in looking for fabric
Also we need to schedule a lunch with Erica and Jane

Athena OK I will add us to the distribution list

Would you explain the difference if any
In reference to Arbitration we can agree to Arbitration in the English Courts
Daniel will contact you tomorrow in reference to the remaining points

We are trying to hold our own over here hoping to miss the first round of layoffs
I cannot get a confirmation that this is so though
Things sure do change in a hurry don't they
Don't know if my response reached you or not
Did not give her anything to do
If you haven't found anyone else to go I would like to go
In addition I have noted those master netting agreements that have been executed
The other fax number you gave me wouldn't work
So much so that they have forwarded to me an executed counterpart signed by their three affiliates

If we don't eat before I guess we can meet at the bottom of the escalators at the theatre
It would definitely be out of your way

No sense in you having to drive into the city too
I wish I had a ticket for Ann
I apologize for not getting back to you on Friday but it was pretty hectic here
I'll send them a letter asking for these items

Where's my morning email
I don't have anything to entertain me this morning
So I'm glad that they feel okay to travel
Can you put a spell on him
Of course if we do get back together that's bad news for the puppies
How was your trip to London
I saw Heather in the elevator here last week but I didn't get a chance to talk to her
I'm doing a tiny bit better today I think
Probably won't be my most exciting birthday ever though
Yeah I wish you were here to take me shopping too
Well I think for now that he's not wanting to be in a serious relationship
I don't think he ever really did but we just ended up having one
I don't know if that will change anytime soon or not
I'm assuming it won't but hoping it will
Anyway I'm just super-depressed now and my birthday is tomorrow
So I have to deal with the shock as well as the sadness
Did you get set up on AOL instant messenger yet
If so what's your screen name
At least the doggies still love me
Also what about the Aladdin...did you get comped
And I feel like a bad father
I want you to move back and let Mr Bean and Greta live with you and Angus
So will you come back and be my doggies' mommy
What's your work phone
I think we must be staying in the deal
But our stock price is not so great right now
That came out yesterday I think
Enjoy your sun
Don't forget that my birthday is Friday
I need a present from you
A self described animal lover he did not want to place the kittens in the local Humane Society
Chicken is her favorite
We soon discovered that while we can keep Snowball in the yard we couldn't keep raccoons from Snowball
She likes Pike a lot so I don 't throw them back any more
John - Do you have a problem customer
I was wondering if you can speak to the trader/your contact there so I can get this issue resolved
Yeah I remember everything in London being VERY expensive
But I had a great time there I'm ready to go back
I wanted to take Rayfael there this summer but I doubt that will happen now
So you may wanna contact her and give her your condolences
Starting on Monday can we keep this tally on the morning sheet and update it daily
Visit the credit union in person to make your purchases
I'd love to go but I have guests in town this weekend so won't be able to make it
Are you feeling better now
I guess the drugs are wearing off
I was really looking forward to dinner tonight too
I had a bad night last night
I hope you have a better trip back
She was going to go but we can't get in touch w/her
I hope she doesn't hit you anymore
I do agree that you should put a spell on her
In the meantime I will think bad thoughts about her
So did you get comped on the room/meals
If not what's my share of Elements and Commander's Palace
So have you found a new nanny
I REALLY REALLY REALLY need a vacation soon so we should talk
So do you like the new job
Don't worry your reward will come in heaven
So will they get it all spread in one day
I had dinner with Rayfael last night it was a little painful but I survived
They are finally spreading out my land
I ALWAYS LOVED PLAYING IN THE DIRT
Our only neighbor that will actually live on their land hasn't even started building yet
I can't even get my little yard covered
Just not really pursuing it just yet
They had a good time sounds like they did nothing but shop
How is it there
Are your parents back yet
I just tried to relax this weekend
Friday night I = went to a movie with Rayfael
Saturday I pretty much just vegged out a good chunk of the= day
Julie and I went to lunch and ran errands
I went running every day= this weekend too
Sunday I took care of some stuff around the h= ouse
I came home and g= ot right in bed but the dogs really wouldn't let me sleep much
I really hope it does but the best thing for me = is not to push it
So in the meantime I guess I'm a free agent
I don't know if you got my email I sent it to the office
Actually they reacted very well - or at least as well as can be expected
They respect me and know that it's not a choice
And I told them you can't be totally surprised by this - and they said no
They had questioned it before but had not wanted to offend me by asking
At the same time they were holding out hope that it wasn't true
But now they know
I'm very happy to have it off my chest
Sorry to hear about your stomach
So maybe you already read that
I don't have any big plans for the weekend
I actually have a couple of dates but nothing major
I hope it was the right thing to do but I feel like it was
Yes I had a GREAT weekend but I was partying way too much
I've been two times to your house so far
Sounds like Prague is treating you well
Is it beautiful
Tell Peggy I'm not spreading myself TOO THIN...but remember you can never be too thin or too rich
I can't believe the prices
Hope you had fun on your three dates this weekend
You know I am jealous
Peggy says not to spread yourself too thin
You would not believe how cheap it is here
He sounds really wonderful and good for you
I think that is a GREAT idea about the dogs if ya'll get back together
I am so glad to hear that your parents are traveling
We all grilled out Sat with Lolo and family he has his garten looking so
Wish so bad you could've been here
You still didn't tell me about your trip to London
The busier I am the better I am so I'm trying to keep as busy as possible
I need to make some money quick
This one REALLY makes you cry
Thanks for getting those Royal Bank deals out to me
If you think you're fat you probably are
Don't ask us
If it's up put it down
Don't cut your hair
Birthdays Valentines and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can find the perfect present yet again
If you ask a question you don't want an answer to expect an answer you don't want to hear
Sometimes we're not thinking about you
Live with it
Let it be
Shopping is not a sport and no we're never going to think of it that way
When we have to go somewhere absolutely anything you wear is fine
Ask for what you want
Just say it
No we don't know what day it is
That's what we do
Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for
Check your oil

Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic
Let's keep each other in our prayers
MORNING BLESSING I asked the Lord to bless you As I prayed for you today.
To guide you and protect you As you go along your way
His love is always with you His promises are true And when we give Him all our cares,
We know He'll see us through
He ate and ate until he couldn't eat any more
I sure don't understand it but it sure makes a dirty boy clean
You know I've not had a bath a real bath in my whole life
I don't understand it either but it sure does make life worth living.
A doctor was having an affair with his nurse
Shortly after this started she told him she was pregnant
The sleet storm and icy roads added to her tension
Then she paused
Little boys shouldn't see scenes like the one she >>anticipated
But was it safe to leave him alone
For a brief moment Barbara considered going on her way
What should she tell Benjamin
He was staring at the crash >>site his blue eyes huge
And they would see her again
Happiness is up to you
But the change in her was evident
So does it wash away sin or not

I am God
Today I will be handling all of your problems
Please remember that I do not need your help
If life happens to deliver a situation to you that you cannot handle do not attempt to resolve it
It will be addressed in My time not yours
Once the matter is placed into the box do not hold on to it
Should you find yourself at a loss and pondering what is life all about asking what is my purpose
You could be them
Let it go so God can do His job
Early the next day however he was awakened by the sound of a ship that was approaching the island
It had come to rescue him
Kick off your party with Yahoo
But that is not what I meant at all
I look at my daughter trying to decide what to tell her
However decisive she may be at the office she will second-guess herself constantly as a mother
That her life now so important will be of less value to her once she has a child
My daughter's relationship with her husband will change but not in the way she thinks
I want her to taste the joy that is so real it actually hurts
Good morning my friends
Hope you can open it and enjoy it as much as I did
Love you all
I hope you enjoy your day off
You really deserve it
I love you so much
See you later and God Bless You
The Lord is faithful and so good to us
She finally had lost her long battle with cancer
The hurt was so intense I found it hard to breathe at times
I counted it an honor
My life stretched out before me as an empty abyss
My sister sat slumped against her husband's shoulder his arms around her as she cradled their child
All so deeply grieving no one noticed I sat alone
Now she was with the Lord
My work was finished and I was alone
He folded his hands and placed them on his lap
He interrupted my grieving with his tears and fidgeting
I cupped my hands over my face hoping it would be interpreted as sobs
The creaking pew gave me away
I peeked at the bewildered misguided man seated beside me
He was laughing too as he glanced around deciding it was too late for an uneventful exit
I imagined Mother laughing
A year after our meeting we were married at a country church where he was the assistant pastor
This time we both arrived at the same church right on time
In my time of sorrow God gave me laughter
In place of loneliness God gave me love
Yes I do Love God
He is my source of existence and Savior
He keeps me functioning each and everyday
Without Him I would be nothing
Without him I am nothing but with Him I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me
If you Love God and are not ashamed of all the marvelous things he has done for you
I Love You
I JUST WANT TO SAY I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
Can you look into the below request from Canada
Please try to do these yourself
If you run into problems see me tomorrow afternoon
Thanks to several of you who have sent this my way
Laughing so hard your face hurts
Hearing your favorite song on the radio
Finding the sweater you want is on sale for half price
Laughing at yourself
Having someone tell you that you're beautiful
Accidentally overhearing someone say something nice about you
Hugging the person you love
Soon it was every five minutes every three...every minute
But she was in very serious condition
Michael however kept begging his parents to let him see his sister
Michael kept nagging about singing to his sister but kids are never allowed in Intensive Care
Karen made up her mind though
She would take Michael whether they liked it or not
If he didn't see his sister right then he may never see her alive
After a moment he began to sing
Karen called it a miracle of God's love
PRAYER May today there be peace within you
It is there for each and every one of you
If God had a refrigerator your picture would be on it
If He had a wallet your photo would be in it
He sends you flowers every spring and a sunrise every morning
Whenever you want to talk He'll listen
He can live anywhere in the universe and He chose your heart
Face it friend
He's crazy about you
I love you anyway
After being faxed we are to track as sent to counterparty
I choose to be in a good mood
I chose to live
In their eyes I read 'he's a dead man
Godly Wisdom looked it over and let it ass
Thinking he had won the game Satan wound up and fired his first pitch
Bob answered that he did not know why
Love faith and wisdom will get you on base but only MY Grace can get you home
After you do make a wish
A real friend has shoulders soggy from your tears
A simple friend doesn't know your parents' first names
A real friend has their phone numbers in his address book
A simple friend brings a bottle of wine to your party
A simple friend seeks to talk with you about your problems
A real friend seeks to help you with your problems
A simple friend wonders about your romantic history
A real friend could blackmail you with it
A real friend opens your refrigerator and helps himself
A simple friend expects you to always be there for them
A real friend expects to always be there for you
Today I pass the friendship ball to you
Pass it on to someone who is a friend to you
When will they learn
God just actually showed me this is how I'VE been acting
It is the Lord Christ you are serving
It's a little long but it's food for your spirit
To all of my friends with lots of love
Not locking your doors while driving
Trusting people to be alone with your children
PRAYER: May today there be peace within you
When you receive this say a prayer
Prayer is one of the best free gifts we receive
Where there is pain give them Your peace and Mercy
Where there is fear reveal Your love and release to them Your courage
Where there is a sin blocking them reveal it and break its hold over my friend's life
Bless their finances give them greater vision and raise up leaders and friends to support and encourage them
I ask You to do these things in Jesus' name
As many of you know the opening of Enron Field is quickly approaching
However we anticipate that the demand for tickets by employees will exceed this allocation
And it most cases this type of wisdom will do more for our lives than any degree could
I've learned that no matter what education you attain how many diplomas you gained

When you figure out which it is you know exactly what to do
They may seem like a godsend and they are
They are there for the reason you need them to be
Sometimes they die
Sometimes they walk away
They may teach you something you have never done
They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy
Don't feel embarrassed cause only you will get the results

The cabin was so remote that it had no electricity

My son Joseph and I have follow-up appointments on this day
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call
I've learned that if you pursue happiness it will elude you
I've learned that whenever I decide something with an open heart I usually make the right decision
I've learned that even when I have pains I don't have to be one
I've learned that I still have a lot to learn
Sometimes they just need a little something to make them smile
Holy Spirit I ask you to minister to their spirit at this very moment
Where there is pain give them your peace and mercy
Where there is self-doubt release a renewed confidence through your grace In Jesus precious Name
I have this awesome jigsaw puzzle and I can't figure out how to start it

Moses and his people were in the desert but what was he going to do with them
They had to be fed and fed is what he did according to the Quartermaster General in the Army
And just think they were forty years in transit
I think not
God took care of these things for him
Still you might think the best financial advice says don't have children if you want to be rich
Feeling the warmth of fat cheeks against your breast
Cupping an entire head in the palm of your hand
I am resting in his love
I thank you for the morning prayer
I really needed to see and hear that today
She picked it up and looked at it before opening but then she looked at the envelope again
There was no stamp no postmark only her name and address
I don't have anything to offer
Nonetheless she felt good as she headed home her meager offerings tucked under her arm
A man and a woman both of them dressed in little more than rags
As she watched them leave Ruth felt a familiar twinge in her heart
I'll figure out something else to serve my guest
Here why don't you take this one
Then smiling she turned and walked back to the street...without her coat and with nothing to serve her guest
Ruth was chilled by the time she reached her front door and worried too
She fumbled through her purse for the door key
But as she did she noticed another envelope in her mailbox
It was so good to see you again
Thank you for the lovely meal
And thank you too for the beautiful coat
The air was still cold but even without her coat Ruth no longer noticed
If you love Jesus send this to ten people

The tree is our parent
And tell your kids
I went to a party and remembered what you said
You told me not to drink Mom so I had a sprite instead
My own blood's all around me as I try hard not to cry
So why do people do it Mom Knowing that it ruins lives
Someone should have taught him that its wrong to drink and drive
Maybe if his parents had I'd still be alive
These are my final moments and I'm so unprepared
I wish that you could hold me Mom as I lie here and die
I wish that I could say I love you Mom So I love you and good-bye

If you let the dogs chew the phone lines you will never get your DSL service up and running
If you are short of dogs for chewing let me know I now have five

Call me with your comments
This was forwarded to me by Jeff Hodge

I do agree with your last e-mail
If the foregoing list is okay we would like to start the interview process Wednesday afternoon
I have suggested to Harry and Carlos that we jointly interview each applicant
Hope to see each of you there
I assume that this was assigned to ENA
Both Carlos and Harry are pleased with her work
I have her resume if you need a copy
Have you looked into the authority issues yet
Grant I have incorporated the language you provided to me in the attached document
I have reviewed the proposed draft resolution
George I would suggest that the necessary language be added to the Special Conditions block of the Transaction Confirmation
Veronica She did not make the changes you requested to cover both contract and non-contract transactions
What do you want me to do
To the extent your lawyers have further comments I would be happy to talk with them directly
Russell Have you sent me a credit sheet on this
However we would like to have this done under a contract
I learned to use the Internet to pass the time
Based on preliminary information he feels that this contract was not set up to use as a master
I'll keep you posted on what Dan wants us to do
Maybe we can go over these today
I'm not trying to make a big deal of it
Let me know if you see the same thing
I'm sorry if I came across the wrong way - the trouble with email vs face-to-face communication
I know you've been pretty busy handling other desks as well and I appreciate that
I will forward same to Clarence Mitchell
Peter Ed Sacks asked me to forward this to you
Per our conversation on Friday regarding HPL please coordinate with Clement to issue a new guaranty
Tom/Steve - Do you agree
Steve I made the same change to both Oneok and PG&E regarding payment following the service month
Please check each document and if okay please forward to the counterparty for their execution and return
Grant I have made the changes they requested
I will send it to the counterparty when you are done
I am not available on Thursday morning
If you have any questions or unable to attend this meeting please let me know
Sandi As you know I am out of the loop relating to the assignment issue
If not can you forward to me an updated list
Thank you for your explanation of the billing process
Your email raised some questions for us
If our interpretation is correct it is not clear why a Master Firm is needed
We look forward to your responses
Good meeting you and Larry yesterday
As far as the contracts a couple of clarifications and an answer to your question below
One quick question we forgot to ask yesterday
Would it be so many days after the end of the month in which received etc
I won't be long I'll be right back
Two days later while his mother is making tea he rushes into the kitchen
Jan Can you let Christian know that I will not be in the office on Friday
Grant I have reviewed your requested changes and have made the changes which do not require explanation or clarification
I do not think their is an omission
I think the language is clear as written
I am still waiting for your language
I have made the requested change relating to GAAAP
If the City cannot make these representations then we need to know that before we execute the Contract
It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated
Therefore we object to any listing of approved parties who can transact
We don't understand it
We do not as a matter of legal policy agree to arbitration but we will mediate disputes
This process is less formal and less costly in my opinion
Thank you so much for considering these issues
Look forward to hearing from you soon
As a cow you must go to the field with the farmer all day long
Any people that come in you will have to bark at them
You've got to make them laugh and do monkey tricks
Make them laugh
You will enjoy very much in your life
All you need to do is to enjoy and do nothing
Have they reviewed the master previously
If so I have been wasting my time inserting the credit requirements into the standard agreement
Let's discuss where we go from here
This was the reaction that I just got from SMUD
I am assuming that we didn't incorporate any of their language which is fine
I received your e-mail
Have you read that one
Cats do what they want.
When you want to play they want to be alone.
When you want to be alone they want to play.
They expect you to cater to their every whim.
They growl when they are not happy.
When you want to play they want to play.
They leave their toys everywhere.
They do disgusting things with their mouths and then try to
Michael Hopefully I have fixed the page number on the header label in the attached
Janet I have changed the attached for ENA
Mark I have made the changes noted in the fax which you sent to Jeff
Once the contract is finally executed Jeff will return one fully executed original to you for your files
If you agree that it should have been assigned as the letter says I will assign it today
If I do assign it Coral will no longer have a firm master contract for trading
I will also have to remove it from EOL
Please advise at your earliest convenience
Ed I am still waiting for you to tell me which Deal Person is the contact for the counterparty
Therefore I am still waiting on you to tell me who trades with this counterparty
I am holding the contract for that person

What choice did I have
I wandered around made my sensible choice and entered the chamber of horrors known as the fitting room
Eventually I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit
At last I located it flattened beside my seventh rib

It was cheap comfortable and bulge friendly so I bought it

Q Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables
Q Is beer or wine bad for me
A Look it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables
As we all know scientists divide everything in the world into three categories= animal mineral and vegetable
My advice Have a burger and a beer and enjoy your liquid vegetables
Q How can I calculate my body/fat ratio
A Well if you have a body and you have body fat your ratio is one to one
If you have two bodies your ratio is two to one etc
What did he mean
Q If I stop drinking will I live longer
If you stop you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time
Q Aren't fried foods bad for you
In fact they're permeated in it
How could getting more vegetables be bad for you
Q Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the middle
When you exercise a muscle it gets bigger
As we all know scientists divide everything in the world into three categories animal mineral and vegetable
I KNOW I SAW ONE SOMEWHERE

I have an electric knife
It stands to reason that I will eventually win

Seeing as tho' they probably won't trade pulp & paper I won't worry about that

Second we have since got an ISDA master in place with Utilicorp
Based on the above I am opening up Utilcorp

You say that they should only trade Australian power and weather
On Japanese weather I would suggest we do not load up the following Ergon Macquarie Generation and Snowy
Hence they should be only trading Australian power and weather
I would like to check this one out further
It is OK to sign the copy I emailed to you
Thanks for your prompt attention with this
I have already responded to the counterparty
Now it's your turn to have fun

Since the new products are already being traded I would appreciate your answers at your earliest convenience
I forgot one thing
Do you remember
By the way I can't believe you're alive
By the way you've been quiet I thought you were maybe in that plane too...
At the request of Sara Shackleton attached is our form of Letter of Credit
Having both of them included in the certificate will be fine

Do you want me to pass your request on to Credit
But you should check with Tana Jones in Houston
Tracy can you start looking at their credit/financials for me
So it would not be power deals
I think it should already be in the blue file
They don't pass documents on to our group
Therefore I sent a confirm out incorrectly
We can use the Deemed ISDA format I already sent you
Is that our standard convention
She can get you copies of any documents in the future
Do you know whether those are our standard rounding conventions

Dave finally got the amendment to the ETA signed so I am fedexing it out to the counterparty today
I keep trying to email them but it won't go thru
The icon below should get you in to the database

Mark Elliott just introduced me to another charming aspect of English culture the Morris Men
I've got their website bookmarked
It's funny each one of you imparts different aspects of English culture to me
I am constantly amused
I think we would have to talk to Utilicorp
Please recite it to yourself using your best BBC English accent
How are you and the baby doing
We hope to see pictures on your next trip over
Thank you for the lunch invite
Not to mention my own private valet
Well Mr Elliott I do believe I am quite shocked at your allegations of me being the troublemaker
How was your trip back
The grapevine says you also did some mighty fine two steppin
We probably won't see you for a few years but I really enjoyed our dinners and chats
Stay out of trouble and make us proud
We miss our Tim from Texas...stay in touch
Apparently IT here call you and you put the call through to your video conference room
Any problems please let me know
You forgot to have me off the week of Thanksgiving too
As you recall we are acting as agent on behalf of Morgan in connection with their commodity business
Since it wasn't an assignment what should I provide them
What should I do
I just got an update from the OMLX of their rules
Also I get faxes of all their notices
Do you get copies of their notices
I thought of you this weekend
It doesn't pertain to you
I know Jeff has been getting similar emails
Also I asked her to let you know what her thoughts were on the proposed amendment
Just a confirmation we have the following lawyers scheduled to attend the upcoming conference you Justin Paul and Jon
I kinda remember them being a plastics company back then
Just me Justin and Paul
Incidentally I have told about four different people this
Would you like to respond
I just wanted to give you a head's up in case we get the trade we're not surprised
Mark what do you think the next step is
At Mark's direction I am sending his note below regarding utilities
Did we order that special UK sized paper
His work was top notch his subcontractors did a great job
Also his sheetrock guy did a wonderful job
You cannot tell where he repaired sheetrock holes
To sum it up I think with Louis you will get a good job for the money you pay
I am forwarding them down to you
Sorry for an inconvenience this might have caused you
I spoke to the fellow at legalanywhere.com today
Let me know when a convenient time would be for you maybe Tuesday sometime
A reminder for when you get back on Monday
I spoke to Mark Taylor
Can you ask around and let me know
Anita sent me the message below re board resolutions to trade out of Singapore
Who will you have sign the agreement
What do you usually do
Per the resolution it needs to be a VP President Managing Director or Chairman
Thanks for your note...which was totally helpful as usual
No I haven't met Matt in fact I don't know much about him
Is he here now
I would be happy to help in whatever way I can
I will of course be sad to have you leave us
I hope our lives will cross again some time
Best wishes for your future you deserve the best
Mark should we forward Carol's email to Bill so he knows what the issues are
Can we get a very quick legal approval of this please
Pls letr me know if you have Qs
With respect to Online Trading Mark wanted me to follow up with you re insurance/reinsurance company issues
Do you have a list of those companies
What are your feelings about that
Can we trade online with Swiss Re
Or do you want me continue to say no
Are you getting excited about going back home
Have they started to think about hiring anyone to replace you
I looked at Gillian's website and she is adorable
I've bookmarked it and I'll keep looking for updates
By the way weren't you out for vacation
Did you have a good time
Let us know what you think of their comments
When are you coming in
When shall we have dinner
Masters that limit weather trading or contain another trading limitation in the master only per our conversation
Either way you cannot trade online without meeting these special signatory requirements
However we can still not do financial trading without having a master in place
ECT has a master in place with them
Saying all that I don't know what if any trading Morgan continues to do outside the U.S
I need to talk to London and find out
Per our discussion it was my understanding that the GTC's would be attached to all outgoing confirmations
Bob Shults asked for your direction with these holdouts
I guess the physical people are OK with that
Please let me know ASAP we hope to get our letter out Monday
Shari per the emails below have you received or do you have any other advice we need to add
If not maybe another time when you are available
Please contact me should you need further information
What would you like to do
Pat remember a few days ago I was trying to track down this Argentina power deal with Duke
Mark FYI also I don't know if there are any problems with power out of Argentina
Do they want to show it to a non-affiliated entity
Liz and Christian Yoder reviewed the description since you were out
He says he never hear back
Can you call him and give him the sign off
Credit/Mark let me know if you disagree with any of my changes
This is the one where they wanted an exculpation clause for the partners and that is totally unacceptable
I discovered it was a non-ISDA master so I had to delete the weather
However Forcenergy says it will not return any collateral constituting a mineral lease
When you have a minute let's look at the form together
As you can imagine that has meant looking at thousands of counterparties contracts and legal issues and trading restrictions
Anyway if that is the case we may need to look at that form
See you're always in my thoughts
Missed you at the seminar
I hope we'll see you at one of these soon
I hear you had dinner with our friend Molly Saturday night what happened to the relatives
I'm asking because he will have to sign the incumbency certificate before Kate Cole obviously certifies to his signature
How do you plan on doing this
I will send a copy to you
Send them over to Edmund with the ISDA Master Agreements
I think that should do it
All their trades must be done by telephone
Credit keep us informed if they do trade
I did see the IPI presentation and was pretty impressed
It made it all clear to me
We do not have a master agreement in place with them
I am approving them for all financial trading
Please call me if I am not clear on the worksheet
Can you please get her access
I'm not comfortable that what I have is the latest
Second we will need to add some drop downs to deal with online trading issues
We do indeed and I will shoot a copy down to you
I faxed over some changes Thursday
Also your attachment is unreadable because the columns are overlapping
Just tell them they need to fill in blanks in guaranty
Marilyn Colbert usually provides them to us
Thanks we really appreciate your help
Mark asked if you could add something else
Let me know if I can be of further help today
Is there anything I need to do on this project
Please reply with your correct room and phone number
Attach this note to your reply Thank you

We hope to finalize our recommendations soon and get the project up to Haedicke for his approval
I'm crossing my fingers for a quiet day
My mom came down from New York and it was colder in Houston than it was at home
Mark asked me to handle this
I looked at the Banque Paribas Agreement
Can you get them to him
Thanks for your prompt help with this
I know Peter appreciates it
I think in his job in Fuel and Energy Risk Management he is probably the business contact
As far as sending my Lotus Notes comment I just did that manually
Of course we can still not do financial trading until we run through all the hoops with them
Yes I had already approved them for trading without any restrictions
When I got the signed master in it just meant that the confirmations now took a different path
Credit has already provided us feedback on them
Thank you and regards Rahil x
Please remember to keep me on this distribution
Why don't you send them directly to Kate with a note to return them to you
Below is a copy of your flight information
Please have your itinerary number available for the agent
Please let me know ASAP if they are approved to trade
That seems reasonable to me
Obviously we need to still input the trades
I forget my attachments all the time
Attached are the final lists for this week for your approval
Are we available
If we have to we will
Shall I fax the executed copy back to your attention
Can you please provide me with your fax number

Please let us know if other changes should be made
Kimball Bay State and The Energy Authority were all amendments even tho Credit didn't have them marked as such

At the request of Dave Samuels I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement
If the agreement meets with your approval please return a copy to me via fax no
Just as I suspected
However the CP is requesting that we not send these Confirms at all
We'll have to share thoughts when we're done reading it
I know I am late but no issues with this counterparty
Are we missing any Japanese counterparties
Since we last discussed the above I think I have only formally approved one Japanese counterparty
As soon as I get copies I will get you copies
Can someone from the power team provide this to them
I'm passing this on to you for review
I sent a copy to you a few days ago
I hope you should get it shortly
I will request appropriate security access to inactivate the records

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing but slightly reformatted
We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have
Just make sure that she has an updated book
Also can you verify that my book is updated since we use it to make the other copies
Is it okay if I provide these to Anne

Dave Samuels thought I might want to confirm this with you
Per John's request I will be calling you about contracts below
These are the two folks I have been working with
No I think I sent my email to the wrong online distribution group
Does this agreement have some particular significance for us
I do have a copy of those

If anyone is aware of any problems here please convey them to Carrie ASAP
At the request of Ed Sacks I am also attaching a sample form of Enron Corp Guaranty

So you don't need to worry about this
I really don't know anything relative to contracts numbers
Do I owe you any other lists
So what should I do with this
However your sheet shows them open for financial trading
Usually you will close a counterparty for financial if Credit does
Do you want them to trade financial online
Do we have an ETA with Koch Petroleum Group L.P.
Please let me know when you get a chance
I am not involved with the EnronOnline
Can you please e-mail or fax this agreement to me

Can you go over your directions and figure out what's wrong
The ISDA that I faxed you is not executable can you send me one that is
See how your weekend goes and yell at me sometime
I know you sometimes work or nap on Sundays
I certainly understand if that is your choice
Yes I'm trying to get our computer guy to figure out what's the problem
I can't get into the site
I have heard that others are having the same difficulty
I think Cheryl just tried to add a note and couldn't
Mark was going to ask you who keeps the final copy but I thought you were keeping them now
Jason our new computer floortech has discovered why we can't get into the system

So on amendments that affect power I am going to have to send you an email about the change
For the above counterparty we originally had them open for power sales only
Now Credit is coming back thru wanting to open them up for the bid and the offer

Obviously he is on a short time frame so we need to respond rather quickly
Russell we need some direction from Credit on how we want to proceed on this assignment

Best wishes for success in whatever you decide to do
It has been a pleasure working with you over these years

Could you please provide us with credit for this master
I got a clickpaper list today from Carol North
Is she a new member of Credit
So I should expect to get my future clickpaper approvals from her
Do you have a contact at the Counterparty
It is not where they are headquartered that necessarily matters but where they are incorporated
Thank you for your prompt attention
John it's good to hear from you
A few things on your paralegal friend
First we don't currently have any openings though we have tended to hire paralegals with a lot of experience
Also we recently hired someone and I don't anticipate us hiring for awhile
You could forward her resume up there with a note it might get it more personal attention
Also if her undergraduate degree was in business obviously she might have some more options in other groups
Do we want them open for power or not
I can't believe Justin does this everyday
I'm with you on Montana
I checked the files in the big file room and it is a Montana corporation
I was just a little afraid I might need grease
Will it be on tomorrow's list
Keep me posted...have fun
Do you still want them to do power sales only
Thanks I know I've been a pest to you today
I cannot believe they have a power marketing license there
Are we really trading those products because I don't think we should be...
Can you help Angela with this
The billing code number apparently does not mean anything to them
I haven't forgotten about it tho
If you think anyone needs it just forward it on
It sound good to me
Keep me on list
It was good seeing you both the other week
Let me know if I need to contact them
Did you follow up with this counterparty yet
If not I'll look after it
I just don't want both of us calling her
No specific action is needed by your group
Yes we can help answer this question
I will be out of the office until tomorrow
If it can wait I'll get an answer then
If not then please let Kelly Lombardi know and she can help while I am out of the office
Could you please clairfy
Our project is a little different so I think I am OK
At the request of John Cummings I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement
You've got them shut down for power but Credit's notes are specifically opening them for power
Should I open or shut down
I feel the power
I am overriding Credit
Do you have copies of the Alberta and British Columbia Acts
I know they are less stringent than the US rules but I don't know the exact levels
Can you e-mail to me the new Canadian Annex
That is it for now
I've got everything I need now
If we put the swap forms back there they can get at them
I know because I've pulled them up myself from London
I have spoken to Taffy regarding this matter
If any of you would like clean versions of such documents please access them through the SWAP FORMS directory
Hey Mark I think these are yours
Please let me know if it meets with your approval and I will email it to the customer
Perhaps you meant US crude and crude derivative/refined products

Please process and let me know if questions arise
OK for you
Please check to make sure it is ok then send for signature
If you remember we pay this fee on a quarterly basis

Sorry but I have no clue what that is all about
Weren't we also going to get a printer in the area
Any chance we could get this spun back to them today
I will get them done today
Can you change on my calendar
We figure they are using the website for price discovery
Yes it will also be there today
Tana If at all possible could you please approve Sabic Americas this morning
If we could only do it for real
Can someone please call her
I'll make sure that we get the confidentiality agreement moving forward
At this time we prefer to use our form documents
Does anyone in Credit know the answer to this question as I don't
I was just following about these trades
Maybe you need to prepare a print out of the trades and send to debbie me & bill
We only have a draft of the original Price Posting Agreement in his file no signed copy
Can we find out who is doing them
First we just can replace profiles
If it is a simple a a name change or some mergers maybe
If it's not we may have to assign the trades over
I just can't move the profile
I have no records of a name change/merger here do you

Can you make sure this moves on to legal
I password protected it
We will be discussing a clearing project with them
When do you think that we can have it sent
I've been advised that its complete but haven't confirmed
I'll let you know in a little bit
At the request of Kim Detiveaux I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement
I think that it would be reasonable
She needs to get a copy from London I would suggest contacting Matt Dawson
Are you familiar with the above
If so is it possible to provide soft copies to Jane McBride
Could you show it them under the same term and condition
Who is our contact in Credit on APB or BrokerClient
Do you see any problem with the assignment
Per our conversation yesterday please find attached herewith the draft of the Assignment
It was a pleasure having you as a houseguest
I really appreciate your putting me up for the weekend
I would very gladly return the favor if I can
Which reminds me
The tickets are free you just need to reserve them
When I find it again I can send it to you
Do you have copies of any of the following NDAs
Can you meet with me
Can you let me know whether Enron Corp has any Confidentiality Agreements with the counterparties below
Attached is the proposed form of NDA for your approval
Enron as usual made its money on the spread between the bi= d price and the asking price
People couldn't get their work done
In time it would become many workers' att= itude toward the company
A former executive routinely carried two laptops on= e for the company and one for himself
People may have been rich at Enron = but they weren't necessarily happy
Pipelines power plants-they may have been Enr= on's pride but Skilling wanted them gone
Key executives left divisio= ns were dismantled but she remained
So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian They gave Mar= k her own company
Performance is going to take c= are of our stock price
As it turned out that description applied to Jeff Skilling too
But now that he was abandoning them wh= en the company was in trouble it was different
But on the day we meet Skilling is looking forward not back
Were my int= erests aligned with the shareholders
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures he is nestling hims= elf back into the world of ideas
His eyes flash as he talks about new tech= nologies
In f= act he is already shopping for office space
I'll have you the fax numbers in a couple minutes
At the request of Marc Eichmann I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement
Thanks for your help Kate
Thanks for your help I really appreciate it

If the amendments are not executed do you still want them
Please check with me before you Fed Express the NDA
Frank and Tana Per my voice mail message here is the Enron corp Guaranty for Hess

Joe can you get me the fax number's
I do not know the exact arrival time
Can you please call and find out
I'm sorry you're bring me such cold weather for this week
I am proud to be an American...
I could not agree more
My mom sent me this...what do you think...
My mom sent this to me
What do you think...
I thought you might like to see this
I was there
I saw it
When earthquakes hit distant cities it is the United States that hurries in to help
If so why don't they fly them
You talk about Japanese technocracy and you get radios
You talk about German technocracy and you get automobiles
You talk about scandals and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at
Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded
When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke nobody loaned them an old caboose
They will come out of this thing with their flag high
Will you have time to look at this
From your end what has been the general position on exclusivity
Please review and provide feedback to Dan or I
Can you send me the aricles and bylaws for another company Enron Transportation Services

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne Travis and Marcus
Yes they are to prepare all the UCC filings
Same question as in my prior message
Specifically should we also prepare filings
The required revisions to the form language should be fairly self-explanatory but please call me with any questions
Reading all that should keep you busy for awhile
I don't know the answer to this
Let me know if I can add anything
How did this work for financials was it from a Tagg feed
Currently it is impossible to implement these business rules in Global Contracts
OK so it is very likely that GKCOM cannot provide a contract for all deals
I am still using the list
Can you give me an ETA on this request
I have changed the profile but Legal and Contracts need to look at it before it goes through
Please let me know your decision
Can you please handle
However for several reasons we did not sign it on the Enron side
I would like to resurrect this agreement with one change
I will take care of getting the Enron signature
Please approve or make changes to their new NDA

Your firm has an ETA with us
Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter
Would you like me to fax it to you

This explains why she keeps asking Winston for help
It's not that the work is beneath her
Some members of Tanya's team came to me complaining about Winston
I don't think that it's just Tanya's issue though I agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful
By the way the project I gave to Rice students is exactly the same as the project for Wharton

I'll discuss it with Mike and Eric this morning
How is your group structured these days

What's your suggestion
Should we discontinue the FBBLOP
Should we cancel it
Can we set up a brainstorming session when your schedule permits
Let me know if you foresee a conflict with this time
I have received your message regarding Mike Roberts
Mike deserves to be compensated for his exceptional contribution
In my view it was a mistake to remove Mike from power support
It would also mean a lot to him personally
I read a few books during this vocation
Especially a stochastic processes book I finished the entire book
The queueing theory is very fascinating and hopefully we can apply the theory to a real EBS project
See you on Tuesday
I am glad I could help
Look forward to working with you
I would like to thank you for forwarding my resume
Sometimes it comes from legitimate institutions sometimes it represents scams

I am COL DAGOGO KALU

I realize this sounds inefficient but remember there are over six billion Induhviduals
It's important to keep them busy
Herein I offer my description of the luxurious NYC hotel experience
I'm struck by the similarity between my situation and John Gotti's
But here the similarity ends because his current living conditions are far more luxurious
If it were possible to make a room smaller than its bed I would be in that room

This leaves plenty of space for your clothes assuming you wear the same pants size as G.I

Apparently it was stolen from the conference room
Another student could not find his way out of the building
Where did you find that
Solution They make us wear our uniforms UNDER our clothes
I kept all my papers in a briefcase

That way you don't need to use your fingers or necktie
I love it and I'm hard to please comic-wise
The names have been changed to make them funnier
You make them out to be bad and stupid people
You really need to think about what you are doing
I wish you had given this information to Mr Adams sooner
Perhaps you could clarify that in a future correspondence
Obviously you are not a student of history
Fortunately for us all I have too much class to allow that image to enter anyone's mind
And I love True Tales of Induhviduals
And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be mocked I can help
Here is my available schedule for next year
I could fly out late Wednesday night

Vince I really am enjoying this learning experience
However I will check in my e-mail regularly

I will ring Mike tonight i.e
I will start setting up my models over CONUS this week
Please give him my E-mail address or the phone number
I am in a somewhat delicate position
But he is clearly very unhappy at El Paso so as a human being I felt it was appropriate
In this respect I can understand his unhappiness
Unfortunately for him however I also think it is in his nature to whine.
He does not seem to suffer well people he considers fools.
But don't take my word for it
Talk to him and see what you think.
Obviously I would ask that you keep these comments in confidence
I have given you an honest assessment -- brutally so.
I shall try to call you from home
I don't see any major problem
If you have an interest in discussing the matter further please give me a call
I would appreciate your comments.

In fact he usually figures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations
If so what do you recommend that he do to get his foot in the door
Otherwise I hope this e-mail finds you doing well and not travelling too much
I think you called his bluff
If he does not fax a copy of his paycheck stub we should not talk to him
He never talked to me about it
If he made a true statement about his compensation he should have no reservations about sending us the confirmation
He said that he would be happy to do so but I never received the fax
I have not heard from him since and wondered if he had contacted you
If not would you want to get together to discuss our next step
I has a very good time visiting my son in California

The tulips are too excitable it is winter here
Stupid pupil it has to take everything in
They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations
I am a nun now I have never been so pure
I didn't want any flowers I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty
The tulips are too red in the first place they hurt me
Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly through their white swaddlings like an awful baby
Their redness talks to my wound it corresponds
Nobody watched me before now I am watched
Before they came the air was calm enough Coming and going breath by breath without any fuss
Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise
They concentrate my attention that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself
The walls also seem to be warming themselves

The cruise ship had something they call a gambling casino

It's embarrassing to think how wrong I was
Thanks to the help of a professional decorator and Pam my bed now has fifteen pillows
When not in use they go on the floor with the bolster

If someone enters your office remove the pen from the drawer and close it in one smooth motion
It's frustrating because other people don't realize how brilliant you are
For some reason that seems better to me

Or they might become butt crack addicts
She downloaded my web pages and gave them to me

He is a wonderfull asset to our efforts

With my move to EBS should we accelerate this
I'd value your thoughts on this
Per your request I've attached a copy of my resume

As to the paper Tim Crack and I have a revised version of the paper I gave you
We have since found out that by using certainty equivalence our model is more robust
Given we can only measure the skewness in our risky world our model becomes much more significant
I cannot read this message
I could not open the attachment
I concur with Vasant
We always face a challenge with summer interns we don't want to expose them to too much information
How would you plan on using him
If you agree let us check with Vince and then interview him
I would anticipate him working as a summer intern
Becasue I have several interview plans with other companies
But I would like to work at Enron most
So if I can get the job at Enron I don't want to hang around others
Keep bugging me for them
I definitely don't want to increase my capital loss carry over
Unfortunately it is not me
I will think more about it when I have free time
Of course if you have capital gains you can use losses on your option position as an offset
I guess I could just throw this article away
However if you believe that ENE is reaching its peak
That is you still keep the flexibility of your options when you short-sell
In conclusion the only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your short position

Vince Just to let you know I finally got in touch with Fiona Grant
Five signers were captured by the British as traitors and tortured before they died
Twelve had their homes ransacked and burned
They signed and they pledged their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor
What kind of men were they
His possessions were taken from him and poverty was his reward
The enemy jailed his wife and she died within a few months
His fields and his gristmill were laid to waste
They had security but they valued liberty more
They gave you and me a free and independent America
Some of us take these liberties so much for granted but we shouldn't

Not surprisingly they emphasize methods to approach the types of questions that are of interest to finance academics.

Thanks for your help and advice.

I told them that would be a copywrite violation
Is there someone at Risk they could call to get permission for this or is it even worth calling

As providers all vie for customer attention and try to satisfy every user need their messages are becoming confused
As a result customers are confused and providers are unable to differentiate themselves or their solutions
So how do we get past the competitive chaos
We get past it in typical free-market style
In our opinion this is already starting to happen
Remember the lesson learned from the U.S local telephone service market Successful companies always consume their friends
It happens because consumers demand it
It is to reduce the noise level and make it simpler for the customer to understand your solution
Make sure you are sending a clear signal if you want to get through the noise
That's six and you may have more
Each has its own maintenance requirements
IBM claims it is aware of the problem and provides workarounds

My housemate recently surpassed his usual high standard of stupidity
A couple of days later the office manager came by her new cube distressed
I asked her how long she had charged the battery
So he copied them
At the end of the exam we were informed that there were TWO tests alternating by row
But he got a good grade anyway
I was told that my calculator worked differently than hers
It was recommended to him that he use a pencil
I could use the blank paper later on for other purposes
Since they must be cut to be removed they're tamper-evident
Um...and where do you pack those scissors

If you wear a raincoat it's a strangely satisfying experience and you can hose it off later

Then she asked me if I had another card
Editor's note That's exactly why you should pay for your lunch using a phone company calling card
Two threw their breakers due to the high load on them
Several small fires started throughout the building including our now half-melted Christmas tree and our molten-menorah
The resulting publicity got us on television in five states
The moment I opened the door I was almost swept off my feet by an overpowering odor of gas
I was confused so I attempted to clarify
It was still in its shrink-wrap
These are based on real e-mail to me
Some names have been changed to make them easier to mock
You were duped in your last newsletter
Shame on you for falling for that
I'm working with him on learning to say no

Enron has an even higher opinion of itself
Start with a pretty straightforward question How exactly does Enron make its money
If you thought Enron was just an energy company have a look at its SEC filings
And as Long Term Capital taught us the best-laid hedges even those designed by geniuses can go disastrously wrong
But Enron says that extrapolating from its financial statements is misleading
In the end it boils down to a question of faith
Vince I did cancel but I think they will charge us anyway.

As you know Tom Halliburton is in Norway this week

She was a student at Rice University who took my class
Has this position been posted by your group
Unfortunately the job does not provide much challenge to me any longer
Also I am really missing the energy field the team environment and all that
Most importantly I would like to apply the knowledge I acquired at Rice and continue learning new skills
Banking turned out to be not quite what I expected
Anyhow I went to the Enron job site again and found an interesting position
Also can you give me some indication of the timing of different meetings
Sam I asked Maureen to write on my behalf

We will have to make copies and mail them
Please let me know where to mail them
He will email you a copy as soon as he can

Thank you again for your time and consideration
However I am very interested in learning what Debra suggested and what decisions were made
I have several repairs that need to be done at home

You may see it as a syntetic storage
I don't think I have to be involved
I just received a call from Scot Gallagher at Arthur Anderson
Please advise if you would like to attend
I find the proposal OK
Although I liked the idea of the levels being tied to energy I don't like the titles
I would like to see some additional options
I will also put some thinking into alternatives
And don't tell me that brooms hadn't been invented yet
It sounds like I found a new bowl
He also has corrective lenses to enhance his vision
That's a pretty good argument for defining him as part man part machine
The disturbing thing is this To whom does he pledge his allegiance -- machines or people
And we'll all become slaves to our machine overlords
Highways will be filled with humans carrying SUVs on their backs
Television sets will make you dance for their amusement
Before you rush to label me paranoid consider who elected Cheney in the first place
I think this is how machines reproduce

At the checkout clerks asked customers if they wished to donate a dollar to the Jimmy Fund
Geez I thought don't those poor kids have it hard enough already
My first year of graduate school I moved into an apartment that didn't have a smoke detector

I shall ask Vacant to attend

Mike and I decided to call you anyway Thu morning your time directly to discuss the matter

I think Christian has a strong preference to be in the Research Group assuming he moves to Houston
I hope it helps

My colleagues must return their home site in this day
I think it's a low risk proposition
Vince I think we can use Kyle as an associate
I love this
Every time they repainted the lines in the road you would have to buy a new car
Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason
For some reason you would simply accept this
If we did this place would look like a cemetery
Do you have any earthly idea how much a building costs
Why don't we just start our >>own
I read your paper with great interest

Thank you again for your help
The Commission has not done all it could or should do = to allow Alliance to develop Breathitt said
Just wanted to keep you guys in the loop
I think this would be a very good idea
In all we are lowering ratings on seven companies price targets on thirteen and earnings estimates on sixteen
Within this constraint we look for signs that mitigate this exposure
Now we are on the downside
We see four principal risks to our more cautious stance
Ultimately we think the principal cause of the decline in power prices is the dramatic build in power plants
We will watch for these signs and adjust our outlook accordingly
This factor is a wildcard for the group in our opinion
If/when they occur the cancellation of development plans will have two effects
First it will confirm the increasingly difficult industry environment and would likely be perceived as negative
I hope your cross country trip went well
I shall expand your slides by adding a few more
I shall rely on your judgment you know better what is the level of sophistication of the students
About my CV I have finished a Ph
If you can not it will be ok to use the email
Of course I thank you very much in advance for your help because I understand you are very busy
In this case I achieve the same results
I do not really understand what might be happening
I do not understand why since the underlying in this case is the forward price
You can not imagine how much I appreciate your answers
Perhaps it makes sense to shorten it a bit
I think the highlighted paragraphs can be removed
The oservation Christian may be smart but he will one hell of a person to manage given his personality
Hope to see you on Monday
If so I'll fly over to meet them with you

He was a widower and she a widow
After about six seconds of 'careful consideration,' she answered
The meal ended and with a few more pleasant exchanges they went to their respective places
Next morning he was troubled
Try as he would he just could not recall
With trepidation he went to the telephone and called her
First he explained to her that he didn't remember as well as he used to
Then he reviewed the lovely evening past
Hopefully we can reconcile our schedules and meet soon

Many thanks for your note
I really want to stay in touch with you
Sorry its too late
You're wrong Most pioneering dot-coms failed not because they were first but because they were dumb
But the fast-follower advocates had it wrong as well
Companies that over-drive an emerging opportunity often under-drive it later on
So it is critically important to ask some questions Are there difficult technical hurdles
AOL Sun Microsystems and Quicken-maker Intuit have all done it at one time or another
I don't believe any company should set out to be a follower fast or otherwise
In the end the distinction between first mover and fast follower hides more than it reveals
Sometimes the company that does this is the first mover and sometimes it is not
I was planning on attending a job fair this afternoon
If your schedule is flexible can we meet instead next week
Larry does not fit the profile of my group

Mike as the rest of you know has an amazing talent for bringing out the best in people
As he told me Friday I have indeed grown in the past two years
The credit for much of it goes to Mike who lives the philosophy that we called Enron

We thank you in advance for providing this letter

Our system will format the emailed text appropriately for display unless you ask that it be treated as fixed-format
Thanks so much for your participation
Something to brighten your day
So Jake did what most of us would do if we'd have been there
He humbly bowed his balding head and sent aloft a prayer
As he turned the key for the last time he softly cursed his luck
They found him three days later frozen stiff in that old truck
Now Jake had been around in life and done his share of roamin'
But when he saw Heaven he was shocked - it looked just like Wyomin'
Of all the saints in Heaven his favorite was St Peter
Or does he randomly reply without good rhyme or reason
Please let me know it is critical for us to have someone from your team to come

As has currently been the practice Asset Operations will pick up the expenses for his time and efforts
If you have questions please advise
I think this is a good idea
Although the contract looks like it only allows us Intranet use and not Internet use as well
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to inquire with me
If the issue gets external I don't know how any of the parties will respond
While both parties were expecting the notice it may leak into the media over the next few days
Please defer any questions or comments to either John Ambler Larry Morse or myself regarding this issue
Mike Smalling John and/or I will keep you informed of any relevant events

I just had to share this with you
I hope you haven't seen it already
I have a longer detailed version as well as numerous references that I will be pleased to furnish you.

Then I'd go into how our plants in Florida represent a very reasonable inobtrusive solution for Florida

I am leaving the building right now but John will be in touch

I'm glad you had the chance to work with Linda
I need your comments by noon tomorrow
Please let me know if you have questions or comments
I just spoke with Clark Smith head of Elpaso's merchant arm

I'll be glad to add you to the email list
Thanks for letting us know
We will compile a room list from here however and you will not need to make a reservation directly
We will send you a confirmation number once you hav= e sent us your hotel needs
I agree with Mark's points
Due to press of other matters I will be brief
Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this

I am compiling a contact list
I won't be able to make the call on Monday
Good meeting you
Sorry not to get this to you sooner
How about I give you a call when I get back
Talk to you then okay

As per our discussion let's discuss this further next week
I think the original invite when to Ken and Jeff
Attached is the document I mentioned
I will be in Japan most of next week but my office can reach me
His credibility is highly linked to his highly liberal positions
Most pundits will see this for what it is given the source
But we will see him soon
Also did we cover the shortcomings of the Japanese market sufficiently
I am not sure that Ken's schedule could accomadate that but I thought I would ask
If timing is bad for a meeting like this we can find a different alternative
I will follow up with a phone call to you
I will appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience and again thank you for your assistance
If there is significant coverage it probably will be tomorrow
Forward to whomever you see fit
If you are not the right person for this topic I would appreciate suggestions for other speakers at Enron

She also said since the Governor has worked with Ken she thought he might prefer that he attend
Talk to you Monday
Stan has asked me if I would like to attend
I would but don't know when exactly it is scheduled for
He made the points you had prepared
We anticipate that we will use gas but in either case we will not pass the emmissions threshold
I will keep you in the loop as we proceed
He likes the approach we are taking to the problem
Could Duke and/or Enron agree to split the expense with us
But I will communicate with Harry and everyone else before then

I have attached a copy of one of the letters below
Please let me know if you have other views
What does it all mean
I got a voicemail fro Ken
In fact Sarah and I have used it a couple of times this year and it was very effective
Before we proceed I would be grateful if you could contact me to share your views on this
If you don't remember your password click on Forgot ID/Password below the Log In button
Does your personal data need updating
In preparing for the logistics of the meeting please let me know if you will conference in

Can you please take the lead in responding to Tim re FERC v state actions
I know that we are commenting on this proposal
If it is not approved by FERC what can the Californians do
If you hear anything on this matter please keep me posted
The only question I have is why doesn't IT just take care of this without a charge
I would decline
What do you think about her idea below and Enron's involvement if any
I imagine you heard about it
Would love to hear your thoughts first before I engage in further conversation with Susan
Send more as you do them
Congratulations on your new assignment
Yes I did meet with JoAnn last Friday
In light of the announced change I am wondering if questions and comments should still be addressed to you

Thanks so much for your message

I didn't sell any right

I talked with Ken yesterday
Ken was meeting with him the day before yesterday
Steve I need your help in responding to this question
Thank you for your time and the opportunity to express myself
Thanks and I wait patiently for your responses
Should I try to accommodate this request
Margaret I do not support him
I got the email through Steve's
I have asked Bill Kristol to do the same
I bet you both can't wait to really get away
I am calling Rob Walls to see if he can attend
I asked Kevin and he told me to ask you
Mark This is the article I mentioned in my voice mail
After our last meeting I think he would feel the same way
I just need to check schedules for now
Is it time to formally establish a KM group

He has a small consulting services contract with me to write on liberalisation of energy markets
I was just talking to Kyran who mentioned your impending move back to Houston

Or shall I wait to hear from your successor
I gather you're off on holiday now
Enjoy the last dose of British weather - if you can.
Linda - as we discussed adding a sentence on open access is key
Ed asked that we not circulate these to anyone
However I am not sure we should be alarmed about that
Also Ed would like to position us as the coalition leader of the White House outreach effort
I am glad I did not attend this meeting
Let me know if you have additional thoughts
They also wanted to post it on Enron's public web site
If this is correct we would have no problem with it
Obviously we would need to talk some more about this
I would hold off for now
I think based on our discussion that Ira might be a fit for my organization or EES
In short like no other utility executive I have met
PLS let me know that this is ok
Thanks again for checking - I really appreciate it
If so will you want a hotel room at the Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill
I may take you up on it
Could you e-mail Dave and I with the background any effect on us etc.
My apologies if I mischaracterize anyone's position
Could you give me a couple of target dates
Thank you for participating once again in the video for deal central
And thank you again for your participation
We determined that the message would need to be targeted specifying the terms of our commitment...i.e
I'll keep you posted on the progress
I look forward to our discussion
Couple this w/ our energy star award and we have GREAT environmental messaging
Sorry I left Jimmy off the note I know he must be doing a good job
It was a team effort but you should know that Jimmy Mogal also was very involved
Along these line I'd like to be able to give you a brief update on activities and issues
I just saw the NYT article
Congratulations on your new position
This all came up rather suddenly at least as far as I can tell
If you have any interest I would like to talk to you sometime
The revised statement looks good to me
A quote from you about this issue would be great
Have a good weekend and I will call you on Monday
Would suggest you try to get it on their desk by Monday morning latest if possible
Obviously we will divert any requests we get to you
I heard you were a big hit
FERC also indicated they were in fact auditing compliance but in a non-public way
Let me know how this sounds
Hey -- you're talking about our future President
The amendment does not surprise me though
The Seminoles have not only a tribal web site James Billie has his own
Check it out--it's a hoot
This is a request for help from my colleagues in GA
The quotes are accurate but I did not say California does not have a supply problem
Do you imbed the URLs differently
I will get Steve to give me a short description
Dear Office of the Chairman Could I beg your indulgence for just a few minutes please
Tim I enjoyed meeting with you too
As I mentioned I thought your answers were thoughtful well stated and accurate
It was a real pleasure to meet you yesterday and I look forward to hearing from you again
Nonetheless thought you might find this of interest
Those guys do not have them
I will make all necessary arrangements to ensure a pleasant visit
He's shopping us
He did say he was leaning toward Enron though
Below you will find this week's cultivation assignments
Please call or e-mail your candidate to help express our interest
Please also keep me posted regarding your efforts
I would like your insights
We have also asked Sen Mario Gallegos for his support and received it
Can we use the same technology
From the employee feedback we received we will plan to send slides in advance to the video teleconference locations
Perhaps we should consider putting something together on India
Is this something you would be interested in/available to do
If not who would you recommend sending it to
Let me know if this suits your fancy
Your assessment makes perfect sense to me
However I see a couple of significant problems
Also I would not anticipate that he would be available for several months if then
As for our search using Korn Ferry I have narrowed the field to two very good candidates
Drew has strong networking skills which I think would nicely fit with Tom's strategic and technical skills
I have a second opening for an enviromental advocate
That said please let me know if I should have Nels pursue Andrew
I attach a draft letter for that purpose
Can I please get the final copy
What are your thoughts on public subsidies/tax breaks for MEC
Yes Steve received your fax
I'll find out when she can do it
As you might have expected Elsa already had a to do list a budget information on schools etc
I really did not have to discuss about moving to Houston
I also need to find out about relocation and visas etc
I am attaching the FERC order and staff recommendations
It's good to hear from you again
Also I'll copy Jim Derrick so he knows we might expand our relationship there
I hope you are well - I KNOW you are busy
Does this cause you any concerns
Do you see an issue with pursuing this
How do you suggest I move this forward
As you may hear from time to time things are going well here in Oregon
I am sending another version shortly that has that information included
I don't think I need anything more from you unless you have other comments on the memo
Jim Hughes asked the same question you did
If you need more lets talk
At first business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just looking for savings anywhere they could find it
Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent
Critics say Gasunie has so far failed to unbundle these charges although it agreed to do so in January
If there are any opportunities in your areas could you direct me to the appropriate person
This is an issue we need to stay on top of
Please call if you need any additional information
Thank you for your call
I am looking forward to working for you
Should I fax it to you
Also my dissertation is quite lengthy
I look forward to seeing you again
I let her know that you would be preparing the briefing
I just checked with Jeff and Ken
Sorry it didn't work out
Apparently there are more areas that I will identify in due time
Think we all know this issue
I think this is a very interesting idea
We need to keep pushing information to them regarding these issues
Feel free to use it
I'll include you guys on future e mails
Also John Neslage so he can keep these updates and a calendar for the Team
Should I be putting Steve Kean on these email updates
Linda--how do we want to follow up on that request
I will continue to work on setting that up
I definitely want to bring it up at the CEO summit
Thanks for your input Steve
Mr Skilling's office is hesitant to allocate more than two hours without your recommendation
I need your advice and recommendation
I met them at that time
I am waiting to receive an update from Martin
Emerson is highly decentralized and our efforts to date have been unsuccessful
Please let me know your recommendation on this matter
Let's schedule it ASAP
Call or e-mail when you have a suggestion
I am not the right person although Lay sent me a note on it
Mark Holsworth Corp Legal has been our representative
Mike Hicks and I have been working with Mark Thibodeaux Corp
Per my voicemail message to you I have forwarded Will's resume for your consideration

Actually Brian sent it to me on Monday and I followed up with Ann and Barbara
I'll let you know if anything further develops
I think we should do this meeting soon
Or wait until you are otherwise back in town
You can still have them review information do their homework and tailor their remarks to Enron specifics
Also you should definitely include Paul Portney at Resources for the Future
Recently I had the good fortune to meet Ron Hosmer
I had mentioned to Ron that I worked for Enron and informed him about what we do
If you would be interested in talking with Ron I would be happy to introduce him to you
I apologize for any confusion

By separate cover I will send Jeff Dasovich the summary letter desribing the proposals
If changes are required please contact Brian Cragg of our office
We need to follow up with Finance their counsel and DWR to allay their fears- the sooner the better
Finally Lingbloom said he will circulate a proposal of his own by midweek next
But I would be interested in hearing your thoughts
Sean - is this anything we need to follow up on
If you can figure it out please let me know how to proceed
Is there someone I should contact to get on the list
The company said it would have no further comment
There are clearly some areas where we are very far apart
There's no evidence in past performances to indicate they wouldn't be
Already communities like Pittsburg have cut deals with power generators before letting them build
Simon's effort might be the farthest along but he also has the longest way to travel
That is one option under a bill passed last month by the Legislature he said
So we would ask that people continue with their conservation efforts
Now also facing blackouts they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and toward themselves
Fundamentally the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system just as California has its own
All were built to hard-wire the nuclear project to its owners
If too many went up it would be investors not ratepayers who suffered
And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate according to industry figures
But this time some Western leaders think they can change all this
In Arizona state officials have gone from having no proposals for new power plants to being buried by them
Again many thanks for your time and I was delighted that you were enthusiastic about our concept
I believe Joe discussed this with Steve
Had he heard from Enron
He said no and that he needed to have some better feeling about the future of Azurix
If there is a view that no one is solving his problem all hell will break loose
But few can say that he is still suffering from inaction
But now that Davis has taken the lead role he faces risks if the plan fails
There is still room for improvement in California particularly when it comes to conservation
Could you send a hardcopy to me there
If you have questions please contact me
While I encourage you to give generously any amount is certainly helpful
It is an effective way to give back to our community
However it could be for naught if the other utilities cannot work out deals
Despite the significant hurdles that remain we believe the momentum toward a constructive outcome is improving
To that end we maintain our Accumulate ratings on EIX and PCG for high rate accounts
If I've missed anything let me know
I am digging for more information on these timelines
Let me know if anything in here is not clear
As you have probably observed power markets have been severely tested this summer
How might we respond
Shasta Lake City too has its own utility but does not generate power
However he said he has concerns about his ability to attract higher-paid designers with degrees in mechanical engineering
Looking back the governor may be regretting that he dismissed the proposals
Now however Duke says its offers are off the table
However he said he had no meetings planned with FERC officials
Sorry I think you should talk directly with Rosalee
Do you have any information for me regarding this
This year they would like to honor Ken Lay if he is interested
I am also sending a hard copy by regular mail
Please set up on my letterhead
A presentation by you on this or another trend would be most welcome
Please give me Amy's e-mail address
I'd like to get in touch with her
I was introduced to you by Michael Moran
Again I appreciate you fitting me into your busy schedule
I enjoyed our conversation about the East Asian economy
I will be graduating this June with a J.D
I would like to express my interest in joining your group

Let us know if that will work
I hope to see you in two months
I will bring hard copies to the meeting
Thank you very much for the note
I found your presentation and testimony enlightening direct and informative
Thank you for showing to the world Enron is synonymous with intelligence knowledge and respect
They probably are already involved but nobody's bringing me into the loop from that end
Some of their demonstrations in Andhra Pradesh recently turned violent
Not being familiar with the site access or connections to the outside world I can't comment on those aspects
Obviously you don't want things to go that far
Based on that you can take the appropriate steps to deploy your own security force
Very occasionally they do get out of hand--and one has to be ready for that
Thank you and if you have any questions please let me know
I'm still trying to sift thru this but I thought you should read
Time is of the essence and not on your side
Nor are the facts & the law on your side
Therefore you need to find a way to get us to be on your side
If you prefer a hard copy mailed to you or the recipient please let us know by e-mail
Thank you for your business
Unfortunately the IRS ruled against our request
Should you be there
I am looking forward to meeting with you

I am available to discuss this at your convenience

I will feedback after that
I know you guys have been working around the clock

As you'll recall you asked for a California energy expert
Jean has responded to Rick and I
Please let me know your thoughts on how to proceed
Spears the other Republican appointee is not at all free market in my view
I am looking for some good folks
Because of EOL and our own concerns we intentionally toned it down
I believe in fact that it is just another platform as well as an investment
I am available if you wish to discuss this further
Do we want to position this the same way
The contract allows Envera to issue a press release subject to our approval
Attached for your review and comment is the proposed release

Or won't you need such a market
Is it straightened out now
However we will try to have as many committee members present as possible
Anything else I can do to help out here
As advised I will forward such querries to John Ambler
I think there is merit in pursuing this
I will be presenting at this meeting
I know Chip personally as of course does Leslie
Chip is a fine man and deeply involved in his community
Any chance we could pass word on to Sen
If you get a chance to talk with Steve Cane about my application I would certainly appreciate it
Thanks and I'll see you back in Roswell
You have very kindly directed us in the right direction before

And we would benefit enormously from your participation
However they've been contacted by someone else about the date so we may be forced to decide rather soon
Overhaul your budget process
I'd love to get your thoughts on this idea
I have looked it over

I think Jeff's comments were taken out of context
Frankly we'd get slaughtered if we said anything else
One of the messages in my testimony will be customers should be encouraged to choose

Before we can offer an outside person a VP position the Executive Committee must sign off
Then we begin the offer extension and negotiations
The person we are recommending is Linda Robertson one of the two people I mentioned to you before

There she has been engaged in an interesting balancing act
Since July she has been working full time for the Democratic National Committee
Can we get someone in IT to respond
If you're not the right contact for this do you know who is
In case you aren't familiar with the book Beth Tilney has a copy
Let's keep it up
And what does it get in return for this largesse
In its actions overseas Enron has made a practice of taking advantage of corporate welfare
And it has enlisted George W Bush in this effort
For his part Lay tries to put his contributions in a favorable light
If he does it is very likely Ken Lay will be pitching in for another inaugural bash
Congressman Edwards has been very helpful with our defense procurement issues and we have contributed to him recently
Jeff is on this board and they asked us if we could enlist Ken Lay to deliver this keynote
I think the electricity section needs some additions though
The answer is open access so power can get from where it is to where it is needed

Let me know at your earliest convenience.
Let it go.
Use this in your favor
This is affecting us in Cuiaba
So they are meddling in contract negotiations
Secondly I would raise the issue of open access pipelines especially allowing Bolivian gas to flow to Argentina
In Brazil I am not sure what to raise
Their concern is not the US$ it is control
Of equal importance is our meeting with the Sao Paulo Governor
We are making a little progress it looks like
I can point to several examples
If you are unavailable it would be appreciated if one of your other colleagues could assist in this regard
I committed to one without knowing about his vote on PNTR
Sorry I jumped the gun

Inside Mr Stroud's apartment the telephone wouldn't stop ringing and his mother was helping him field the calls
He says he was in serious talks with four companies
And a movie producer was interested in his life story
Mr Stroud now says the DOE should have given him an extension under the circumstances
Would Enron like to be his partner
Enron he said was interested
Still he felt bullish
I just have to tell you that
Next time he vows he will have his own letter of credit
Peek he remains the mystery man of the three
Peek works as a business-development specialist said he had taken last week off
Shutters were drawn at his modest one-story house in Tallahassee
Granted going from tenant to landlord would boost his costs
Arena opponents call it corporate welfare
Adding arena payments to its existing debt would completely tap its resources however
We've hashed and rehashed them often in the past few years
Continued debate won't change their minds
It's better for taxpayers than last year's accord they say
But does it really
Still there is another general rule of thumb when it comes to determining a public subsidy
But the overriding factor is probably simpler he said

I would prefer one with a tennis court in the complex
I have talked to Carol and she knows the process
The recent changes have opened fresh opportunities for corporations to cut their taxes the study found
But economic analysts questioned some of their conclusions
Eury said though that it was not a bad trade
And corporations are likely to sponsor other local events out of their advertising budgets the economists say
And we want our money back
Can we be even stronger on this
I really want to attend but I am having some scheduling problems
In fact they wanted a few more mitigants put in and then shot down anticipating Jeff Skilling-type questions
They're working on the numbers but it will be ugly
I am anxious to get out there soon
In the meantime I'll send a tape of my singing voice
Please let me know if this is a problem
Unfortunately they have given me very short notice and would like an answer by COB today

Otherwise please call me to discuss any changes you might have
In any case we were low bidder and the recommendation was made to award the contract to us
It is not yet clear whether they are going to award the deal to Synagro or re-bid
Politics did not enter into it until now so we were caught a little flat-footed
If you haven't seen it get in touch with Ann Schmidt
Any suggestions on how we can vote
I think we need to keep this going forward
If we let this hang out too long we could lose the momentum
I think you did a good job of summarizing our discussions both as to content and context.
I agree that whatever happens as to outcome these kinds of discussions are far more beneficial than mutual demonization
Once I do I will get back to you
As part of the course we will feature an entrepreneurial company as the capstone class in the course
Do we have any chance of making that happen
Laird Smith and I spoke with Eric Schneidewind this afternoon
They will keep us posted on progress

I am discussing this draft below with Jeff Skilling
I will get back wih you after my discussion with him
Steve asked that I pass the following request along to you
Do we have a sense for how many we can reach how many we can't and where they are
As you can see from the Design Document they are pretty significant
I appreciate you pressing this issue
What happened to the one we were discussing earlier
With an elevated risk level we should begin thinking about these threats
Please let me know how I can help you
I'm not sure whether this is any better but would appreciate your input
I look forward to hearing your thoughts and impressions
I share your perceptions of Jose though I don't have as much contact as you do
I highlighted a few to further discuss
Likewise for consistency we opted not to change them too drastically at the year end
However I apologize that I did not send them to you in advance of that meeting
I think paul has a number of good suggestions here
We look forward to seeing you in January
I think the confusion is in what the term validation means
If anyone can think of anything else that would ease our analysis I would be game
Thank you for all your support on the Arena Proposition
And if the whole project is scrapped you can expect there will be blackouts
As per your request
I think it's justified
Can we get some help on the IBM issues
The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative but they lack commercial sponsorship
Please let us know if you have additional questions
Where do we stand
Or do they not even know their name is referenced here
I have taken a shot a several questions
I need you to run these items by Rick
If we have specifically committed to certain things then let's follow through
If there are things we can avoid let's avoid them
These are the kinds of things we need to consider

This is a decision point for you

Please advise if you have any comments
Is your inquiry confidential or can I discuss it with others
You and I have shared some thoughts on these subjects
My relationship with business units has given me a unique education
At all times my products were considered benchmarks
In addition I shall be able to manage potential political problems that are likely to attend any consolidation

Once again thank you for your time
Thanks I enjoyed it too and would be happy to do it again
Thank you for visiting with my class at Rice last night
Next year if your schedule permits perhaps you would consider a return engagement

Let me know how I need to proceed
A couple of other things I need to meet with McKinsey while I'm in town on Monday
Just get me on the first available flight to Roswell
Also I didn't mean to put you in a difficult spot with Melissa
Don't worry about tellling her my travel schedule
I think this is something we should consider
I'm asking Rob to look into it
This can be very dangerous to your data
I also spoke to Larry Charach of the ADRD
I sent an electronic copy to John Baker
Maureen could you send one directly to Jason and schedule lunch
I would like for us to go out for lunch sometime in January if this is OK with you
Hopefully I will hear back from them tomorrow

If you cannot please provide the feedback by confidential e-mail to me

Many of them have not seen EOL so we need to show them that as well
Please contact me should you have any other questions.
Anything you want me to do
These are also detailed on our CA web site at www.Duke-Energy.com/California
I don't see anything technically wrong with the document but I struggle to see the point of it
I can explain further if needed
Something that you have not been telling us
At this point I'm not sure how many if not all of you have the wrong info
I apologize for the confusion
Please let me know if you are available to attend
Thanks for your courtesy this morning and recommendations for further contacts

Look forward to talking with you
I agree with Rick
I know Jose is tied up on current business but his input will be important
Cindy Olson referred me to you suggesting that you would have the information mentioned below
I got your voicemail
I suspect someone in total innocence is forwarding my e-mails to friends and family etc
If you think you know where the leak is please please let me know
If we can't find it these e-mails will cease and desist
In case you were wondering yeah ABC is not happy
Could you confirm by e-mail
The answer to this question may determine their willingness to serve in some cases

I can provide more detail if needed
We appreciate your performance response
Christi- this is how I changed the footnote

Additionally I have attached a calendar of the orientation for your review
Steve let me know if you require additional information

He has been told that he needs to find something now

The Finnish government expects to lower its ownership further
The largest new entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall with its acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity

First the government should create a clearer separation between itself and the state-owned PPC including a separate regulatory agency
Incumbent ESB plans to split off its transmission business which will remain state-owned

Check with her one last time and then let it go
Thanks for your help and HAVE FUN

Do we have anyone that is available to attend this event
Anything you want me to do at this point
Do you agree that we should be discussing exit package
Cliff may feel that he has the need for David
If that is correct I want to run one idea by you
Seems to fit his skill sets based on prior government experience that he has
Is this more of what you had in mind
Let Mike and I know what you think
I'm sorry but Steve just let me know that he will not be able to attend tomorrow's luncheon
Would you have any time this Friday morning to meet
Yes you are
Am I looking at this the right way
I have summarized the main visibility we received
That's OK I was going to use it in the presentation but it wasn't essential
Was my talk what you were looking for
Let me know if you need it and by when
I look forward to the discussion
I look forward to our call sometime tomorrow
Where do you stand on this issue
At first we were not strongly opposed to the stand-alone reliability piece
Given this we are concerned about how things are going
However we aren't doing much on our own since we would be very ineffective
It would seem to me that India has such an interest
I gave these materials to Sudaker today
Please review and advise us how we should proceed
I have noted in their materials that Mr Alliwalia is among the speakers but not on energy services
With us the market can and did provide reasonable expedient solutions to SDG&E's customers and protection from price spikes

Let's add this to our daily distribution
He has been invited and we expect most will show up but we won't know until they do

I hope you find this helpful
I will bring copies to our meeting tomorrow
Ca you please include me in this also
I'd like to hear their views on south America
I'll let you know as soon as it is set
As you can see I disagree with Mark per the attached e-mail I sent him earlier today
I do not think it should be Jeff Skilling
Mark does not appear to concur with me
So before I ask the Committee we DO want to testify correct
Mark I disagree
Further we can wait to see who PG&E sends and others
But tactically we may not wish to do this
I continue to think this is an unproductive exercise
Let's discuss my changes when you get a chance
Thank you for your consideration of this request
Attached is a draft public statement for your review and comment
I think you have picked the two most interesting industries

My supervisor Mike McGowan sends his regards
My message was sent before I finished it
Good luck with your studies
Congratulations on your progress
Elizabeth I am having trouble getting a churn processed for Holly Strong
All she needs is a desk and a phone
We already have equipment for her to use so nothing has to be ordered
Can you please ask Steve if he can approve this request
This move can not be scheduled until we receive an approval
Watch your money at all times
I have been forwarded this message quite to my surprise...considering my reputation
Steve- I spoke with Gay this afternon
Eliz - please tell me what we have given -- PAC and corporate if any
Sally - could you tell me of Ken's personal contribution
Please put me on the distribution list for future installments
Paul can you talk to Mark and make sure that Sue Ackerman is on board
They asked a number of questions--none of them troubling
They asked when we wanted a OPUC order
Helman asked suggested that we may need to propose conditions limiting anti-competitive gas vs electric practices
Ackerman noted that the Washington Commission would review but that we expected the issues to be limited
We said that we weren't planning any addition private meetings
The resume is attached below for your convenience
Could we work that in
Also Steve I hope we can talk about our business strategy
This is something employees have asked us for
Also please let me know if all of you plant to participate in giving the presentation
Attached is my resignation from the PAC

Jeff wanted me to ask you about Wallis Jefferson
He hasn't called him yet but just wanted your perspective on him when you have a chance

I called Jim Derrick who is traveling until Friday
Jim indicated that he was supporting Justice Jefferson
Steven I enjoyed meeting you today and thanks for your thoughts and insights into Enron
See you around the neighborhood
If you are willing to volunteer contact mike terraso
Will you be sharing/reviewing/revising fire drill/building evacuation instructions
In the past our fire drills have instructed us just to go to the door of the stairwells
If we really had to evacuate the building where should we go after we exit the stairwells and building

Otherwise the report on the prognosis for ultimate passage remains accurate I believe

I would still like to see the data
Assuming he agrees let Misha know
Got your msg
Here's the latest Glamour-Shot of my brother-in-law and his family
A review of their claim revealed errors
However I consider this the maximum exposure from what is known at this time
Due to deficiencies in the data it is also difficult to assess potential exposure
Let me know if you need any more information
I will copy you on significant memos in the case
Please let me know if you would like additional information
I am hanging in and hanging on as is everyone else

If OK how would you like me to respond

Good talking to you again today

Further to our conversation of the other day we have compiled some information on political contributions by other corporations
We're interested in their overall spend their party split and the individual candidates they're contributing to
Most of our individual $ which is significant is given to Republicans
Currently your daughter is not taking Social Justice
I don't have a role for Tom at this time but I appreciate the interest
Steve per my voice mail to you
If you have received this electronic transmission in error please notify the sender immediately
I think we need to emphasoze the reasonableness of our offer
We have asked Cindy Olson to take the lead on forming this group so I am forwarding your message
I would like to participate on the Employee PRC Committee
I still haven't received an explanation
I returned to the office and found this to be true
I was not told that my title was in jeopardy
Attached are the materials that Steve asked me to send you to forward to Mr Lay
Please let me know who will take the lead on this
I think you do need to be there
I work for Enron a leading energy company based in Houston
I wrote some comments last night
We are working on a tight deadline and I suspect the review process will be lengthy
I hope you can return it sometime Monday
Jeannie et al -- I like this story
I think it's very balanced but very long
I'd like Steve to take a look at it
Let me know if I can do more to help
Let's send it out
I left a message
Ken has stated publicly that succession will be internal so we won't be needing these guys
Steve I gave this fellow your phone number if he decides to call
Would you like me to route these somewhere else
It was all I could think of late last evening
I have re= frained from responding until now
Thank you for you= r consideration
Perhaps he seeks mer= ely to entertain
We disagree finding ourselves less trusting of the i= ntegrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders
I realize that only a brief overview was discussed last evening
OK if I forward this to Billy Lemmons or does he already have it
I hope you find them relevant and/or useful
The note is long - consider pr= inting it
Heavil= y dependent on when/where you rotated
And obviously when those expectations are not met we all know= the consequences
I= s it really Wall Street and consulting
Second do they know what they are getting into
More importantly you probably lose m= ore good people then you realize
Rather they are trying to = plug a Manager level position with an Associate salary
Old group did one-way dialogues they would not even listen
I then contacted Patricia Payton
Several= emails phone calls and still haven't heard from her
Further = groups are not obligated to tell people in the pool where they ultimately r= anked people
In addition= it bothers me that Associates are many times treated very very poorly by= their new groups
But you don't need an MBA to be a trader
Add some flexibility to the Program let the peop= le choose their rotations and move without restrictions
If you wan= t to do that give me the courtesy of being up front about it
Right now I can't believe the broad spread in ability and experience = in the associate class
My name is Larry May I trade the nat gas pipe options book and report to John Arnold
Rick Jim and Elizabeth we should look at something like this for the rest of the organization
Your initial thoughts would be most welcome I look forward to hearing from you at your convenience
Steve can you suggest an answer to these questions
Mark Jeff and I worked on the attached and I agree with your assessment but IR was not pleased
Hopefully we can all move on now and get back to the work at hand
I have never felt better about working here
This is the Enron I know and love - honest open human and smart
Mr Skilling said he took that stock-price drop very personally
I received another call today
Maureen -- please put on my letterhead
To echo Greg I am now here and this is one of the many items on my agenda
As you know Tony now works for Mark
I haven't forgotten
I have one last trap to run which I will be able to finish in the next few days
If you would prefer I'd be happy to recommend consider and approve it myself
Alot of my people are outside of Houston
Are they solicited anyway
That would be our preference
Let= me know if you need anything more
I will check my messages when I return
I will not be reading my mail for a while
I think you are the right person to get this
If not please let me know a= s soon as possible
As indicated below Ken Lay our Chairman and CEO would be happy to= put his name to the letter
Let me know if= you need anything more
I spoke to Allan Zaremberg Pres
What messages do we want to modify
How well is our RAC process really working
See me about this
Steve Thanks for your help
I've passed along your information to Byron
In either case let me know if you want me to respond for you
For Southern Co. its reputation as a traditional utility heavy is a badge of pride
Also he said Enron cannot easily move power long distances through Southern's grid
I believe we have this already
Not a problem you will receive a six-month extension on your current individual subscription
If you need additional information please advise
Glad to see you are keeping the world at bay
Are we required to have a formal severance plan
If we are required to have such a plan should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies
He said he would be interested
If you would like to talk to him I'll give you his number
I was sorry to learn about your father
There was a typo in the first one I sent you

Somebody PLEASE help me

Bob can you please provide me with the right home
I will confirm
We still do and you should go if you can
I am asking Maureen to send you the dates
S - Do we still have an active Advisory Council
As you know I participated in these meetings several years ago before the Policy Comm
Let's talk when you have a minute
I felt very successful and satisfied
I never had the opportunity to meet him
However my direct supervisor was Janelle Duree
In effect I was told to lower my expectations
I still find this attitude completely unacceptable
The good news is that I did find an opportunity
I have been promoted to the equivalent of a Senior Specialist
I really don't like the idea of leaving Enron but I feel like I was left without a choice
Letter looks good to me
Anyway my observation is that the problem with being misunderstood does not reside just on the outside
Please let me know how you wish me to respond
She is an extremely bright charming and capable person and I have a lot of respect for her
I hope all is well with you and Carrin and look forward to seeing both of you again soon
When you are prompted for a user name please type enron sip
Please see the attached copy of their floor statements
In March President Bush said he would not support mandatory regulation of carbon dioxide emissions at power plants
Otherwise please approve and return to me for implementation
If you agree please note your approval and return to me
I think we should emphasize at the outset our proposed solution
Are they transferring $ or just responsibilitiy
Steve - I hope your vacation was terrific
When does that start and should I include her for next year
For example Palmer has made some this year as have you
Do you want to break this down by group
Do you also want to illustrate headcount differences
Do you want a chart to illustrate this
I have not yet seen your picture with a pie
What do we think it means for the pace of reform
Is it a mandate
This is still confusing to me
I'm quite disappointed I won't be able to attend
Thank you for the invitation though
The EB team would appreciate a quick reaction from you particularly as to whether the article runs or not
I think you are right most people will elect to travel by car alone or in groups
I doubt that a bus will make sense
It's good to know he is alright
Terrie a warm thx to you
Friends of friends were badly hit however and that hurts all of us
As long as you are sending the plane I am coming
Frankly without the plane it would be a tough decision to make
Thanks for your concern and kindness
As we move forward with plans for our Management Conference let's discuss arrangements for you
Given the uncertainty of air travel we are extending use of our corporate jets to our speakers
I am very much looking forward to reviewing the results
Kelly suggested that the questionnaire would benefit from your review
I hope your friends and family are well
Again my thanks
I'm OK with sending this out but understand that people are up to their necks right now
We might get more if we waited beyond the management conference
Steve Mary and I are ready to send out an email to the potential executive sponsors of the ThinkOut
Please review the memo as soon as possible and let me know if you have any changes
I have forwarded this to Fitch

I will put a greeting on which give new contact information
Thanks for your assistance Jenny
I read about this in the WSJ
Billy - I concour and agree with John's comments
Please give me your thoughts on this
Later this week we will make a decision regarding participation in the National Black MBA Conference in Orlando Florida
Are you running with it
Did you have Bob Long's resume
As many of you know next Monday will be my last day at Enron
Hopefully our paths will cross in the f= uture
Second we need to decide how to deal with the PGE commitment
If we make contrary arguments in the west they will be used against us in the east
We look forward to your feedback and comments
To me you have always epitomized what is good about Enron
During the interview you never once sat down
Your passion was contagious -- it infected me and countless others
You made Enron more than a company you made it a cause
Thanks for your leadership
If you should have any questions or require additional information please let me know
I agree with John
I don't want to show this one to Ken
This guy sounds really angry though and wants Ken to write him back
Mr Lay you and the other executives receive very large salaries
None of you is hurting for money
What's worse you take more from the company every week in the form of pay
I realize you haven't had a soul in quite sometime
I don't quite know how to fire you
Why exactly is Enron paying you
I have learned a valuable lesson
In this pay-for-performance world where does that leave you
And somehow you seem to smile as you keep doing it
Please write me back
Please make sure these individuals know that they have been designated
This is especially important when dealing with our board members
Call me if you have any questions and thanks for working with us on this
They have been working with us for the past few weeks
Feel free to mention them to Chase
We've worked with him and would recommend him without reservation
Peter you are free to say that we did not provide responses to your other questions
With respect to that we have the international solution ready
I will be in touch when the time comes
If I can be of assistance in any way to our department or any other i.e
Just tell me what to do and consider it done
I think you should attend when we have it
I think I need to go to this but you will need to approve it
Citibank will notify me overnight as to which release they approve
He will take care of it
David would you please forward to the right person
Just let me know where
My thought is that if you can you all would attend
Here's my piece on Westwide price caps
I also hope to reschedule Gary Hamel
I will also check with Terri James
For that reason I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference
I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance
Meredith please give Cheryl a copy of our external q&A draft
If you have such a list right now could we use that as a basis for ours
Cheryl Lipshutz is spearheading our efforts
We are not finished yet but we are on our way
Please call should you wish to discuss further
I trust this is what you needed

Could you please respond to this e-mail to indicate your concurrence
In addition please be sure to include any exceptions to your certification
Please tweak the language as you see fit

Could one of you send him a reply
Sorry -- I was not cleaqr
I left Mike Hicks a voicemail message yesterday
Let us know if we can help
I wasn't sure if this was in the clips
Due to the unusual events of the last few weeks we provided some daily information
However we intend to again use rolling averages in all communications going forward
Enron will continue with our asset sales program as previously announced
I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances
We have said that we won't play on those terms
Separately we are working with the city on a demand side deal
I don't know of anything moving forward as yet
Let me know if you have any questions to the above
I hope that his letter will be of interest to you
That's what we are doing
Could you take a look at this
I can skip if I have to
A Thank you for your thoughtful questions
I know you will
But I am not interested in participating
If you have any questions please do not hesitate in contacting me at the number below
I am sorry for the miscommunication my fault
Steve Are you going to be able to make it to Dubuque for Christmas
Good luck to all of you
It asked me for login info
How do you want to go about collecting comments
It looks like I have a sizable additional tax bill
Michelle - can you respond
I haven't seen anything
Thank you so much for your message
I have always enjoyed working with you
It made me smile just to see you
I talked to Ken yesterday
I had also talked to Linda Robertson
I told Ken we should wait a bit and he agreed
I think that we ultimately ought to support a Republican in this race incumbency or no
But I want to make sure we back the right one
Please prepare the letter to McLarty for my signature
I also agree that we can terminate the relationship with McLarty International LLC upon thirty days written notice
I have tried to soften our standard notice
I am terminating McLarty today
Do you have= the agreement
If you are checking e-mail show this to Nora
I showed you your test score and I will return the tests after everyone takes it
You successfully completed Trimester I and we're headed into Trimester II
One might say that I even planned it that way
It will be a similar test in style and difficulty and we won't be doing a portfolio
Don't worry...I know you can handle this
By the end of the year you will be a superb test taker and algebraist
Jeff worked for EES before and came to us highly recommended
Please make the appropriate notations within our spreadsheets
Let me know if I need to resend
As I start a draft of plan A any boilerplate or anything we should incorporate
Any reason we couldn't do this
Steve I think you may have heard a request last week re working closely with Dynegy
I think we just need to treat them like other counterparties
If so how do you feel about the following
Do you think this works
The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance interim governance final governance board make-up and stakeholder process
We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared
For your reading pleasure I send the attached
I don't have any comments to add
You won't like some of the comparisons but it is a nice statement about what our team has accomplished
Tim Pawlenty has now announced that he will run for Governor
Jessie Ventura true to form has said that he won't make up his mind until next summer
Steve here is the contact list that you requested
Mike will provide you with phone numbers for U of C Northwestern LSU UT
The technology is transparent to the participants and this allows them to concentrate on each other
When it is all said and done Telanetix becomes invisible
Enron employees would interact directly with the University and pay their tuition to the University
Telanetix collects its fees from the University and not the students
Additionally we are linking overseas sites to this network in England and Australia
Below I have attached a few pictures of the digital classroom
Can you please approve the following security requests
Sent this out to my direct reports but I wanted you to be aware as well
I have had surgery in the interior of my mouth specifically the lower right side of my tongue
I have been at home recovering since
I look forward to seeing you again in the interview process
Dear Mr Kean It was a pleasure meeting you at the Enron Site Tour
I found this information to be very valuable for it confirmed my interest in your firm
Specifically the innovative atmosphere you foster has appealed to me very much
Let me know if you have any changes or comments
To allow plenty of time to produce these videos I hope to get this memo out later this week
The past year has been eventful and at times challenging for Enron and its employees
Instead we want to look ahead ane even poke fun and laugh at ourselves
To avoid duplication business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address
Either with you/or your transportation manager
I have come to rely on and even take for granted your thoroughness and competence
I hope all of your family and friends are well
In fact I am planning to order some peaked caps and t-shirts with SECURITY emblazened on them today
The security stinks our employees do not feel comforted and we need to do something about it
I am prepared to do it myself
David/Robert can we incorporate into our overall approach
However we know as employees the importance of getting back to the work Enron is paying us to do
How do we balance the two
I'd like to know what your thoughts are on this
I can't believe he would think that's accurate
I think we should wait to communicate this until we have solid positive action items
The other recommendations look fine to me
I have left a voicemail for Greg for his approval
Please feel free to edit the text as you see fit
Also - would you like the email to come from you the Office of the Chairman or business controls
Your approach makes sense to me
As it stands the ESC will split or fold on this provision
Attached is suggested language for our updated travel policy
I will also be seeing Barton tomorrow
FYI I am speaking at his Texas Conservative forum in Austin
Have Mr Lay and Congressman Barton done their follow-up call about the Texas Senate race
Here are Barton talking points per our conversation last night
I'm sure it would be much appreciated
Thanks and looking forward to seeing you
I spoke with Jimmy Glotfelty on Friday
I think we should add that to our message as well
We should point out that he took a very middle-of-the-road approach
Thanks for your courtesy
I think this is fine
I enjoyed our discussion very much
I remember our trip to Dubuque very well
Steve I am very disappointed to learn that you will leave the company
I am saddened that you will be some place else
But you will always be a friend
I think the communication is extremely well put together and informative
The message from Ken about increasing costs should be modified I think

I keep hearing negative things about Lord of the Rings
I've heard good things about it
I think I'd prefer the thriller myself
I don't know if she has any experience doing that
I think that's what happened with them
Good luck with everything it would be great to work with you again
Sounds like a good opportunity but why did they all leave
I wonder if they're starting up their own consulting company
I have a few things presently in the works
I could be good at that
Kelly Little will be working there but other than that I don't know anyone
Have you called Scott Neal back yet
That would be a great opportunity for you
I don't have any contacts at Duke
Thank you for the heads up though
Do you have any contacts there
Scott Neal has been trying to get a hold of me
We would like to send you a wedding invite
Once that book is ready and deals are moved we will be able to report it to you

The DPR should only have the active transactions in it

Kam John we found a few book_id name issues while trying to batch-load the books

Haven't heard back from you on the book codes
Sorry I forgot to attach the completed sheet
I hear you get the pleasure of investigating this
That should solve your problem
Can you figure something out for these guys
I have a concern regarding these new book requests for netco
When accounting pulls the liquidations from TAGG it is by book code and region
Do you know of another field that would provide this information
Do you need Power as well
Yes I didn't realize it mattered
Since these are physical books with deals flowing from Sitara->CPR we should be ok
This should help you
Do we have to do anything for this
If not please call me and I can help
I already sent this to Kristen
Let me know if there is anything I left out
Please let me know if this is everything you need
Can you use that going forward
If there is any problem with this timing please contact me

Also you can use these files to change or update your links
These are the post-id's that we have pulled
Once they get that I will check them against these
Are you going to handle this
I would think that the central books should have two set up one for P/B/I and one for GD

Do you have to have a seperate book for futures and options for Crude unleaded and Heating Oil

Keep in mind it will probably change again
I put some question marks next to Brad John Pete and Sandra's products
You have them down as managing some physical products
Will they be managing those physical books
If not they should go to the physical trader managing that location as before
Can you take a look at those
For those traders that also do deals in canadian dollars we had to create additional books for those deals
These will not have any EOL products associated with them they will be phone trades
I beleive it is Keith and Frank
I don't know who has been saving these daily
So does your PCs' setting
I am available to meet and assist in anyway possible

See if you can open that
Do you know what we need to do to fix it
We can create new ones once it is set up
This needs to be done today if possible as we will have to run the accrual on Monday
This is what Jeff gave them for the terminated deals
I need the values by month for gas only
Please disregard my e-mail
I will notify you when they're set up in ERMS
The books have been created in GCP per your request
Let us know if you require anything further
Contact me if you have any questions
Can you specify which gas daily curve mappings
We can probably load all of them up in excel
You do your editing
We created our own Data Codes and sent them to global counterparties is there anything else different
Lt me know if you have any questions
I think the dropdowns will automatically update
If not please let me know I can modify the sheet and send out a new version
I will send more if I find them
If so is there a spreadsheet kept with them that I can get
I have one question about this form
Do you remember at what price do we own Microsoft
Sanjeev Gupta has been doing this for us in the past
Can you please set up the attached book for the estate
They are supposed to make the switch for us tonight
This should be the end or close to it for the Netco gas book requests
As before could I get the global id's once you are finished
I forgot to attach the spreadsheet
I have reattached the central book request with some additional books
So the need is to verify the correctness of their claim to these charges
The price problem we discusses has been cleared up by Coral
Here is the spreadsheet that we discussed earlier today
That way we won't have to worry about who is doing what everyone in the group will get it
The current controls group did that and it was much easier
Let me know if this is what you needed
Once she completed then I can finish the rest
Please let me know today so we can start ASAP
I will be setting curves for balance of the month
Do you know what the structure going to look like
We will be starting over with our curve files also
Since the number of curves will be greatly reduced we will probably start with one file
Send him an email with a time and place
Should these be zeroed out as well or are we really supposed to bill them
I haven't made it through the whole list but here's what I've seen so far that I'm questioning
Please let me know today if possible
Also if I've left anyone off that needs to see this please let me know
Ok just tell me what needs to be done in sitara and we'll take care of it
It is on PG&E so I think it is yours
Yes my group will be the ones to book the demand charges in sitara
Can you please contact that regional controller for the charges
I have highlighted the risk people in grey

Do you still have a copy saved you could send me
Chris was able to get me a copy of that yesterday
I put in the west desk books already
Susan is checking to see if we can use those portfolio and book codes if not we'll change them
I don't think I know what you are asking
See attached Summary Sheet they all seem to be the same Tagg #'s with different legs
All - Please confirm your attendance by e-mail

Please add any other fields you think we should have
Is everyone ready to start setting up their books today

Louise I obviously don't agree on the decision that was made
Needless to say I am disappointed but signed the document as the deadline approached quickly

Did he find it or was it handed to him

I just received it
Can we have them until we move
That would probably be the easiest time to give them up
No questions - nice to emeet you
Please contact me if you should have any questions
Just told them I thought it would be impossible
My recommendation is to drop them as we have no systems lawyers credit capacity to manage them
Unless I hear otherwise they will be gone

Good morning Louise and thank you for the above order
I will outline some framing and shipping costs below as requested
What's your address
Thank you very much for the camcorder - complete surprise
I received the parcel in the post this morning
Happy Birthday to you
Please advise if you see issues related to their plan
I also spoke with Rich DiMichele regarding the EBS move
As we discussed he obviously does not want to move EBS twice within ECN
Again cost is obviously a concern so the per person cost estimates you provide should facilitate this decision
We need these for Netco - is it too late
In addition we need the Excel add-in build environment for building the exotica DLL and its help functionality
I will help get a complete list of models used
I really do not understand why it is necessary
I do not know if not telling people is fair

Listed below are your HR contacts
For those of you cc:d on this

Don and I agree with fully with Dave and yourself
Would you mind adding responsibility names to each
Mark has a call into you for us
The gas contracts we need include the following can you give us timescales
Mark I believe has put you in charge or gas -please could you give us a timescale
I understand you are swamped but our conversation would relate to the sale
Attached is the Gas Master we discussed
As you can see Exhibit C has been removed
The schedule is probably aggressive depending on when we get a power marketing license
Louise Attached please find our ERCOT business plan for your review
Harry/Jay can you help come to some conclusion on this
If so should I put any new names in their place
Hello glad to hear you are well
At least as of October when I left London they were competitors in the marketplace

I really am not concerned about EES and retail
If so are they going to still be in business
Please let me Dave Forster or Mark Taylor know if you would require further information
Any issues with me contacting on Monday
I am working on producing a fuller list for you today
EES has been soliciting bids for some of its larger markets
I'm assuming this is no big deal as we will still be month-to-month and can cancel
Shall we toss for who rings back
I am genuinely trying to be as reasonable as possible
I am generally ok with the concept of the option the doc and comp parameters
Then have them negotiate that on behalf of me
Because we don't know who from the buyer to negotiate with
For example I have no idea how the mechanics of getting these options done conveyed to the creditors/buyer/estate/judge works
I don't understand why this is a non-starter issue but I don't have the same information that you do
That is not what I want to happen
I trust that you are trying to do the right thing
Finally I apologize for hanging up on Louise ealier
I am comfortable with whatever you decide to do
This is our initial proposal
Louise thank you for your timeline
I hope this will assist you
I have now also heard from Ellie and have responded directly
Did you do anything to it - I can't see
Obviously I am putting limits that we would be willing to extend from a Credit Perspective only
Will talk with you tomorrow
If you have any problems please call me
Please feel free to phone in from whereever you like
We intend to send our suggested credit headrooms tomorrow morning
Can you do on gas and power together
Can I make the following suggestion

I do not understand the Netco/Newco comments
If this is changing I need to know quickly
I will keep you posted on the recommendations
Contracts cannot be assigned - its that simple
Let me know if you have questions or changes
Subsequently I've asked HR reps to notify me of any resignations as they happen
We need to hire him...when we are allowed to hire again
I definitely had a black mat last time
I would like a black mat again
So Ellie this is what you want with a black mat
I have outlined some costs below for you
Do you mean a black mat
I look forward to hearing from you with your final decision
I'll see what else I can find out
We need to make sure we cover all of the expenses
How do you intend to do this under the proposed contract
We are assuming all pipes that we trade today
Is it coming back
Also I am attaching a new marked version which you should be able to open

It might help if I told you the shipping address
If you still have that one on record
Do I get a discount as a returning customer
I would like the Solitude MT,USA photo

The letter will be sent under your name
We will scan it and print on the letter electronically
Let me know who you have problems contacting
We just need people to give us a week
Surely they'll give us that long
I expect we are going to lose some people
I hope the ones that go are not the best ones
Obviously the more we are willing to spend in bonus the fewer the people we will lose
When would you like to get together to discuss
However I felt like I had to at least let you know my thoughts on the following
I was asked to review the preliminary numbers by individual
Dave told me the figures were based on mid year evaluations
As you know mid year evaluations are typically lower than year end
However because the retention numbers were based on this they are significantly lower
If Dave has already discussed this with you I apologize for the duplication
I presume it was based on Brad's evaluations
Can you co-ordinate weather reg and structuring
If you can provide us with contact information we can include it in the attached list
I have master counterparty lists from credit legal and eol

Questions Can we get credit for the origination on top of Enron's treasury rate

The market for their services both inside Enron and outside of Enron has gone up
In addition they received no signing bonus

I just spoke with Chris Edmonds
Got the e-mail Chris Edmonds from TrueQuote sent to you
Bottom line we are absolutely honoring our contract with them
However they want to do more and that is what we are considering
As you know TrueQuote was supposed to be a robust many-to-may site and function more like ICE does today
Well it doesn't
Therefore they want to escalate broker client at a time when we are considering its cost/benefit for Enron
Greg has asked me to inquire about this w/you

Not a big deal I will call Peggy Fowler but thought you should be aware
How much is Reuters paying us

What do we want
If we sue them
If we cannot get a way forward on the monetization then re-review the way forward
Ed I think Dave talked to you about this deal
This looks good especially if you get Harris
What do they want me to be part of if anything
However if we do operations/accounting stuff for them we should get paid
This would include both gas and power I think throughout North America
He wants Lay Alex and me in the meeting
I of course was fighting Alex
Shapiro said he would get Alex working on the talking points
I assume that you will be attending also
My thought was that you could meet with Wilson and Purchase
After the Premier I think meeting Wilson and Purchase is the best use of his time
Aleck I wouldn't have Lay meet with Wilson and/or Purchase but definitely Lavo could meet with them
We have him from one to about six
I think that is the best use of his time
Let me know if you have any other or different ideas
Please circulate this information to all interested parties in your group

I can't assure you yet that I can make it but I would like to try
When I know your availability I can make a schedule
They want to understand our structure. they have not met anyone SR in ENA since Jeff left
On a side note no ISDAs means that they can also not trade on EOL
To date non of these clients have been able to trade on EOL although they are dying to
These clients deal with us because we understand the energy markets. we give them superior service
When I know you are available I'll put a schedule together
Does Louise get to review me next year too
Are we missing one
Lavo John your accountants are now telling me that no cash is trading hands

In addition we need more bodies in trading - particularly if Lambie is shown the door
Can you follow up on this
Give me a call on this I don't understand
Days weeks or months later you discover the trade and take the hit or the gain
These are the facts as I understand them
I'm sure that Stacey White Steve Nat and Monica Lande could fill you in with more detailed information
Setting up a dummy book solves the problem for us but not for Enron as a whole
Given our other priorities and the default logic change we will not pursue this option
When the manual fix has not been made we have true positions for one book mapped to another book
I'll let you know the end result
I haven't seen the latest agenda for Ken
John your thoughts re the attached
Also I think its highly likely that we will get a meeting with Lay and Harris

John Sorry I missed you on your recent visit to SAC
I hope the visit was rewarding and offers good potential
Are you still playing hockey
Allow I signed the stuff you sent me
I really stopped being an Enron Employee early last year
I thought Eric was gas
Depending on the cost profile we would probably still do this
The question is do you buy options on sites buy sites and whether or not you pursue permits
John we have now identified the resources necessary to identify potential development sites in Ontario
Is this still something you want us to pursue
I'd like to either move forward or kill this now that I have the resources lined up
It's administrative and has nothing to do with him
Sorry I didn't realize it was Good Friday
I took the day off
For everyone else that got offered a re-up a year early they did exactlty that
Let me know if you want to discuss it further
Tych told me Lucci was done

Training dates may change subject to desk heads schedules therefore I will update this once a month and forward
Once confirmed I will forward the resumes to the approrpriate traders

Give them the cost if they want the drift
I'm definately not going to support you on this
If you have any questions or comments please contact me as soon as possible
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions
I once again asked about the committee
Come and see me Tuesday I ned some help on South America
Also makes me appreciate more the job of all the guys on the desk

I did not like the article nor the trone of it
By the way did you like the dceg first quarter results
Unfortunately I can't make it
Can you settle this guy down

Tell him to do his time and learn

I agree that he is reasonable
I will get with Teresa to work out the process
Should we remedy this
We can find seats for them
They seem keen on showing us a bid by next week
Call me if you have a question
Let me know if there is anything additional I can do
That's why the interaction of your traders is vital
Hope you can help
I am reviewing now

And let me have your views on how it works
About an hour ago I held a news conference to release the statement below in response
I have reviewed this situation with care
I want to thank those who provided me feedback either in person over the telephone or through e-mail
His taped comments in no way reflect my own personal beliefs
His performance has met my expectations
Therefore I have asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police
He has my strong support to continue
He assures me he is prepared to do so
However for your meeting I would appreciate giving us some time
Herewith is attached the outline for your reference which is tentatively prepared for him by his staff
Please advise if this works with your schedule
I would prefer that we just absorb these costs
I hate to send out additional bills at this time
We are billing everyone for the hotel golf and regatta this week and we have a few questions
When we started this project the cost of the regatta was much less than when we finished
This being said we have two choices
Possibly bill them a cancellation fee or the full fee
We would like to get everything finalized before she leaves
Give us your thoughts
Please indicate below whether or not you will attend the breakfast
I did receive your e-mail
Dr Reed will be joined by Mr William Hauck a member of our Board of Trustees

Dear Ken This is the invitation that Harry was speaking to us about on the plane last night
Please let me know how to respond
Note that they did not mention a starting time
During that time I made a lot of friends who I continue to see from time to time
He was NOT what I would call a people person
Unless you were in an upper level position he did not take the time to find out your name
Not only were they getting away with it these people were being rewarded for this behavior
Heaven only knows how he treats his subordinates
I don't know if you will see this but I hope so
This may just not be something we would do anyway
A free email account your friends will never forget

Can it really be true
This is the story of the night my ten-year-old cat Rudy got his head stuck in the garbage disposal
Clearly I had to do something
Bill then decided to take apart the garbage disposal which was a good idea but he couldn't do it
When all our efforts failed we sought professional help
He talked Bill through further layers of disposal dismantling but still we couldn't reach Rudy
This suggestion gave me pause
More importantly they were also able to think rationally which we were not
Officer Tom expressed immediate sympathy for our plight
Also he had an idea
But they couldn't cut the flange without risking the cat
We laid the sink on its side but even at this more favorable removal angle Rudy stayed stuck
If he were limp we could slide him out
Instead my sweet gentle bedfellow chomped down on my finger hard really hard and wouldn't let go
My scream reflex kicked into gear and I couldn't stop the noise
Should I stop
Rudy's biting me but we've got to get to the vet
I told Mike he didn't have to stay but he just stood there shaking his head
I was working on the suitcases when the phone rang
Um do you have a cat
Bill who had worked tirelessly to free Rudy--and swear that I had been misquoted
If so I would be willing to try to coordinate that effort
Maria or Mary -do you have an answer to Lorraine's question
If you have any questions please feel free to call me to discuss
Please reply back to me with any comments you may have
Debbie Can you work with Jeanette and Bill Rapp to see what needs to be done
Transwestern is getting ready to begin testing their new contract system
Teb do we need a meeting or can you proceed
So if you feel a SMILE begin don't leave it undetected
I think that might be too much for this letter
I think we should take that up separately
For example I think we should work with Marc of FPU on an individual basis and see what happens
Is this an improvement over their previous counteroffer
Please give me a call if you have any further questions
Thank you in advance for always being so understanding
Let me know if we need to discuss
Is this how you think we should be handling
I will be out Wed
I talked with Rod about the purpose of the meeting
I think we need to meet this pm
This is new to me
You might want to call him on the cell
Can we meet before of after the floor meeting
Both are good for me
I have both at one hour each
Teb keeps his own schedule
Please let me know if you have a conflict
Happy Valentines Day to you
I bet yours are doing the same since your weather has been so heavenly
Teb what is the FERC allowed interest rate we can charge customers for late payment
Can we set up a phone conference sometime next Tuesday
Rachel and I have some questions
I have no questions
Frazier Steve Veatch is over reporting so he should probably go instead of me anyway
Can we do it in the afternoon
Rob will give you minor changes
Pleas make the changes and forward to Kevin Howard with copies to Jeanette Rob and me
Kevin - I made changes to the document
I hope they were saved
I am putting a copy in your office also
Therefore I suggest we do neither
Rob and Teb If you would like I will work on this Thursday and finish next week if necessary
Could you provide to me some time next week
There= is no God and I can prove it
Take your tongue out of my ear Juliet I am= talking
So do we need to take them off
I do not think this is urgent but I wanted to ask
I suppose this is another tariff clean-up item
Teb I was talking to Drew and Janet Place last night about some of the Lakehead tax issues
If TW were to do the same thing would its rate also increase
Now get off your Blackberry and get back to having fun
Would you like to reschedule for another day
Did you make an appointment
Had to look up his name its been so long
Thanks for pushing me - I keep putting this off
We thought he worked for us
How you work for Kilmer is beyond me
I will reschedule when I hear from her
Have you heard anything back from Shelly
If she is available what time will the meeting start since the TW staff meeting has been cancelled
Teb attached is the file that Denis sent me
I misspoke the incremental revenues language did get in this draft
We look forward to discussing the attached with you
Please provide your thoughts
Can we get these contracts amended by this Friday
Operationally we could probably handle using just one compressor
Teb Per our phone message could you check on the tariff requirements for this issue
I know that there is an OFO penalty bucket
Is it immediately cashed-out as with the Overage Alert Day or does it hit the monthly imbalance for cash-out/book-out
Do I have it right by saying that in an Alert Day situation the volume is immediately cashed-out daily
When you get a minute please advise
If not do we need to add language that the discounted rate will be between max and min rates
We would like to send this out today so your prompt attention would be appreciated
I will bring you changes to the attachment
This too will be routed to you for your approval
I have your shirt and will deliver it tomorrow morning

After service he went out with some friends for coffee and pie and they discussed the message
I will listen
Again he felt that he should turn down Seventh Street
At the next intersection he turned back and headed down Seventh
He drove several blocks when suddenly he felt like he should stop
Again he felt like he should go and give the milk
Finally he opened the door
If you want me to look like a crazy person okay
I want to be obedient
I guess that will count for something but if they don't answer right away I am out of here
What do you want
The man was standing there in his jeans and t-shirt
He looked like he just got out of bed
The man was following her holding a baby
The man had tears streaming down his face
We didn't have any milk for our baby
How are you doing through all this
I hope you have a happy holiday
However it turns out the end is in sight
Everyone is still keeping you Alina Kim and Chad in their thoughts and prayers
I hope your various ailments are healed or at least getting better
Debbie talks to your Mom and Kim periodically but we enjoy your e-mails when you get a chance

We realize there may be some collateral = damage and for this we are truly sorry
But we must end toaster terror fo= rever

What were the different requirements= surrounding your use of the toaster
Do you toast bread and waffles

The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right so they changed positions
They then decided they both would walk
So they both rode the donkey
The boy and man said they were probably right so they decided to carry the donkey

We thought you should have an electronic copy as well

If we go we need to make plans for barkley
He is a welcome addition to our poor running game

Tim Duncan is what ever the draft personnel categorize him as

I bet you guys had a blast
I still want to see the jokes though
Are you still enjoying the computer
I need to spend some time getting our home machine organized

People just lay out their hearts whatever is on their minds
A mysterious disease now seemingly under control threatened his senior season
Man I was crying
They share it
Then came two losing seasons and the resignation of their head coach Terry Bowden
They revel in their success yet they know it can be ever so fleeting
Today he has the highest efficiency rating of any SEC quarterback
The relationships we have on this team are like brothers
The fun is back in it for us
He's a role model not just for younger people but for all of us

Then you would publish two curves with the exact same name and value just two different risk types

To all am I thinking about this correctly
If Brian is unable to post curve maybe we can post it here

But if you think Tuberville earned his money this year think again
And word is he can't believe the unhappiness in the ranks
What has he done
Of his current squad Tuberville talks of them being young
This is your third year
If you can't stand the heat call your agent and tell him to find you a new job
I still think he is a capable head coach
Except they missed one important element
Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Tommy Tuberville and his Auburn football program

Q My husband wants a threesome with my best friend and me
A Obviously your husband cannot get enough of you
Far from being an issue this can bring you closer together
Why not get some of your old college roommates involved too
If you arestill apprehensive maybe you should let him be with your friends without you
Q My husband continually asks me to perform oral sex on him
Then cook him a nice meal
A This is perfectly natural behavior and it should be encouraged
Q My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is
A Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband
If you must mess with it do it in your own time or ask your best friend to help
You may wish to videotape yourself while doing this and present it to your husband as a birthday gift
To ease your selfish guilt perform oral sex on him and coo him a delicious meal
A You are a bad person for bringing it up and should seek sensitivity training
Q My husband always has an orgasm then rolls over and goes to sleep never giving me one
A I'm not sure I understand the problem
Perhaps you've forgotten to cook him a nice meal
Good morning I do feel better today
Good luck in your talks

Do not walk behind me for I may not lead...Do not walk ahead of me for I may not...follow
Do not walk beside me either...Just leave me the hell alone
If you can't be replaced,...you can't be promoted
If you think nobody cares if you're alive try...missing a couple of car payments
Before you criticize someone you should walk...a mile in their shoes
That way when you...criticize them you're a mile away and you...have their shoes
If at first you don't succeed,...skydiving is not for you
Don't squat with your spurs on
If you tell the truth you don't have to...remember anything
If you drink don't park...accidents cause people
Some days you are the bug some days you...are the windshield
Don't worry it only seems kinky the first time
It has a light side &...a dark side and it holds the universe together
Generally speaking you aren't learning much...when your mouth is moving
Experience is something you don't get until...just after you need it

I know I keep bugging you but I can't help it
Hope you don't mind coddling me every now and again
Can't wait to come to work with everyone it seems like a great office
Don't I sound pathetic today...yuck
Hey where are you
Did you get my last email
I was wondering where you were
I've got tickets to the Broncos' game on Sunday would you want to go
I was in Wyoming Monday/Tuesday of this week
Just got your messages
As for my weekend it was good
I had a group of friends over Saturday night
I cooked for everyone and we had margaritas
I made homemade salsa chicken enchiladas a salad and then creme brulee for desert
I rarely cook so I know two of my friends just came out of curiosity
Hey what are you up to today
Are you still planning on meeting me for dinner
In college I dated a passionate girl but she was too emotional
So I decided I needed a girl with stability
So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition
I'm looking forward to it also
I may not do the ski training class tonight I'm worried about my ankle
When you get a chance call me
At least that's what they want us to believe
Hopefully they send some of these Enron directors to jail
Nothing new with me
I sure hope not...unless its good news of course
Glad to here it
You're not the type of person who expects a lot in return but always know your generosity was...as is...appreciated
Anytime your ready to go let me know
Let me know stud
PS I haven't been able to close any deals with Karen but I feel that I am very close
PS At dinner see if you can seat me next to Nadine I'll owe you
I did fall back asleep in fact I even overslept
But I feel good today real good
Hello luvah just wanted to thank you for dinner and dessert
Hope you finally got some rest some people just can't keep their hands to themselves...sheesh
We may have another marketing guy with us too
I thought you might appreciate the following article in Energyfax
Well at least that was all you guys buried
I know you don't like these types of jokes but I couldn't resist
Did he or didn't he
The caption read did he or didn't he
How do you feel today...sore
I hope I want to be the man please let me
Can't seem to download the joke you sent me what was it
I thought that part about the teeth out was interesting
Many of you I know will appreciate this
A philosophy professor stood before his class
Craig Can you please get with John Cogan on our need for all wire transfer backup
Or I'll spank you
I had no idea that you were seeing someone else
I was under the impression that you were completely available
I found the perfect costume for that upcoming Halloween party
I'll call you to make sure you get it
Hey you back
I'm sorry that I made you feel that way
Don't take it for anything other than I was very busy
I have no problem being friends and even getting together whenever
So for now don't take anything I do personally and feel free to call whenever you want
Do you deserve one
Have you been very good or very bad
I need to know what kind of spanking to give you
Paul PS I hope it closes today
I was kidding about Bob I want your adrenaline to flow
I thought it would help wake you up
I did also
Yes keep me posted on your happy hour
So he said he would like to talk to you
So you see once again I have served you well
I had fun
Will call you tomorrow to let you know when/where we'll be
This week I pick the Colts
I'm meeting Karen tonight for dinner so I'll tell you how that goes
Here is the amendment to the purchase contract please look it over
Beer is fine with me
So you have to drive Greg around all day Saturday
What do you want to drink
Other than that I am bringing Brie and I think that will cover our part
I'm looking forward to Saturday thanks for inviting me
Should we bring anything
Email Whitt for his new numbers
Any hot chicks at your party
The Giants did you in
I would like to shut it down
So send me my pro rata share
How was your party
Call me and let me knwo what you think
Canadians always start their parties early
Is that too early for you
What time did you have in mind
Anytime is good for me
Will there be a lot of people and what time is it over
Here is what about we have been showing Kennedy Oil
What time should I meet you at your house on Saturday
Shoot me back directions to your house
Yeah that party sounds fun count me in
Where do you live and what night is this IPAMS reception
She is alot of fun even though she does bad things
All of her friends are fun too so it should be a good time
Are you going to be at the IPAMS reception tomorrow night
Let me know about lunch
And if you want let's think about lunch next week
I don't know where yet but tell everyone
Are you free for lunch anytime soon
Excuses Excuses the reason you lost was that your team scored less points than the team you were playing
Or we can come up with other ideas I'm wide open
Since I'm so nice and receptive to her feelings I decided to help
But I'm sure you already know this about my personality
I'm really not trying to BS you with my emotional side
I will tell her I can buy the gas into Questar if you believe that to be the case
Can't Petrogulf tell you this stuff
Well I see you have to eat crow
I think they can take their gas in kind at Questar/Bird Canyon but I'm not sure
And finally are you still available for dinner Wednesday night
Yes I am bribing you
I think that's all the super secret information I can divulge
Hope I don't have to eat crow
I will call her
Has she started to date again
I thought she had given up on men after her divorce
When are you going to get your hair cut
I've got a date with Karen this week well at least I think I do
Have you talked to Larry about Friday
I can't do lunch this week
Why don't you plan to pay me at the Halloween party
Have you been to see Brandi yet
What about me picking two winning teams last weekend
Can you send me the latest updated version of the pool
Tell Larry we are going to party Friday so he better go along
If you need anything else don't hesitate to ask
Good luck this week I can't see any sure things out there
So at least I had my doubts
So you want to stay in Calgary another year
I hope you didn't buy it the first time around
We thought it was BS
Now I know
When are you setting me up with your hair dresser
But we do not have any gathering
I'm sure you guys know about Clay Basin
And you know at that age those girls put out
At least I can get drunk on my mom nickel
Are you up for going to it
I totally agree I was extremely stupid
What was I thinking
I hope you're kidding but you should probably go get your stuff checked just in case
I think that chick gave me something
I'm looking forward to doing it again next year
You can use it if I can find it
I may have lost it on Saturday night
I was very drunk
Hello you guys Well I hope you have Dad doing some of the cleaning
Anyway I hope you're doing fine
I'll talk to you guys soon
Paul PS We haven't found a place in Vail but we are still looking
By the way you looked great Monday night
I mean it was bizarre to run in to you there
What do you mean about odds
How was your trip to Wyoming
Did you have fun at the game the other night
Timely note and once again I am already hard at work prospecting for you up here
So let's keep that in mind when we are working through all the credit requirements
Hey have you eaten lunch yet
And when do I get Stacy Mack
If you have any other questions let me know
I'll give you my first round pick next year you give me Trent Green
What do you mean draft picks
We can cover the airport so you don't have too
I'm just throwing this out as an idea but you guys work out all the details
See you guys Friday
Are you getting these emails
I mean what you really look like
Maybe we could go to your place afterwards for some dessert
Miss me yet
Be sure to get your picks in early
I have atteched a spreadsheet with your picks each week listed
PS Don't make me wait NO ONE MAKES ME WAIT
I will continue to work with Dave on Amoco as well as Devon and Texaco
As new information develops I will pass it on
Paul Have you heard anything from Gerald
I short paid the August invoice
I will talk to Theresa and Gerald
What do you mean bummer didn't you pick Oakland
What's up you two losers and I mean losers
I'll give them a credit card when I get there
So smoke um if you got um
No Mark is going to Portland and he just left
You got our picks on Friday right
I also need Karen Taylor's phone number she's hot for me again
I rally like her little assistant Laura
Bob Hey are you going to go to Portland
I didn't work out one day while you were gone
I like your shirt is it new
I know that's why I said that
I just got back from shopping
I bought a new outfit for tomorrow
What do you have in mind on picking out
How is your battle wound today
Why don't you tell me what the real truth is
It was nice to meet you last night
If you bring in your parking cards you can get a parking spot in the new garage
They have space available for you
You have to give them your current card in order to get your new card
I do have two spaces available in the new garage for Mr Maggi and Mr Zipper
Please help me out on this if at all possible
I would really like to make their day
I AM COLD
Can you help me with the name and address to use
It is on my desk I think
I hope Dan is ok Did the antibiotics not work
I know he has been worried but I thought he was feeling better
How old would you mother have been today
I was wondering about Karen
I wasn't sure what her title was before
I haven't checked voice mail yet
Heather called on my cell phone which was fine
I'll figure it out tomorrow
I suspect that it wasn't recorded
I'm not at the office today but I probably have a copy of the Option
I don't recognize the Memorandum of Option to Purchase
Do either of you have copies of these documents
I found the originals so please disregard my question about same
How's you dad
I hope everything went well
For information but no action on your part at this time
I am sure he can confirm that or not
Somehow I'm not surprised that your dad is a quick healer
You know how I hate to have originals
Please take them from me
I will leave copies with you
Do you have to be rich to run for president
Can you see God
Was it fleas and worms
And when he was mad at Neil Mom you picked the wrong husband
Could you fax me the rest
Would you look into this for me
Let me know if additional information is needed
I've already discussed this with Mark H and he thought it had already been done
I haven't found any indication that it has been done
I think the easiest way is a power of attorney
As for the expense account I figure she can just tell Ben to sign her name to the reports
You gave me my laugh for the week
I was wondering if you were there
Hope all of you are staying warm
Just wanted you to know we are here
Could you give me a call at your convenience
That's how it worked for me
These Options are really keeping me busy and they are interesting
After working with Deborah I guess I'm just used to doing more
So I guess I'll just relax and enjoy the new job
Now it isn't always as WEIRD as what you were used to
This is more like it
If my flight is on time I should be able to pick up Michael
Don't know if you guys like to keep up with such things but I'm glad to keep you informed
Do you know where these documents are
If not I guess we should follow up
Sounds like you have a good plan
This was sent to me by one of the developers
Please let me know if this works for you and I'll get us a conference room
There will be other companies but we can add these as we go
Kathleen please advise if there are any which you see as most active at this time
I'll get you the particulars but you get the general idea
Kathleen you haven't done any thing with this request yet have you
Well I personally would like your input although I'm not clear who will end up with it
I really think we should revise portions of it
Do you want my input
I am making some handwritten changes to talk to you about
I would at least ask Ben to identify key regions
However you do need the names of the companies anyway because they are mostly your companies
Kay I left the ENA draft for your review
Was it acceptable
I'm glad you mentioned that fact
Speaking of which are you generally aware of a warranty claim against Westinghouse for the Gleason project
I've been helping Mitch out here and there on it
I haven't heard anything about the project since then
That way us Easterners will know when we are encountering a Western entity
Additionally please forward your original Florida entity files to Kathleen
When the executed resolution becomes available please send a copy to Matt for his remaining entity files
I expect Ben to turn up the heat today
As soon as I hear from Harry O. I'll let you know
Please let me know about the scope of Sutherland's engagement
Good idea to give them a heads up
Unless you direct me otherwise I intend to pursue the LD claim we are due under the contract
Please ask Bruce to check his availability
I will check with her on the status of this
With regard to the policy I understand your point
I made a mad dash to get this revised
If you are there now please send me the current version electronically
When do you think you'll be done
Maybe we can talk soon
Sorry I was cranking this am
Have you heard from Bruce Silvers
Losing someone can make you feel that way even if it isn't logical
When will you know when you are going to NY
I was afraid I would hurt his feelings but he said he felt the same way
I will not have anyone taking advantage of him
Emma wouldn't be nearly as spoiled as she is
Can you tell I'm hormonal I'm just bitching away
Are you ok now with your document
Ok maybe I'm whining but I think Mark should know that we are having problems
Have you mentioned anything to him
Do you have a copy of the legal description
I look forward to hearing from you regarding the above
I haven't read it yet but thought I would pass it along anyway
I will give you a copy Dale
I haven't said anything to Mark and don't plan to
Can you get a picture of the dog
Neil and I have been talking about getting Michael a dog and we DO NOT want a puppy
Does she bark much
Is she hyper
She's a short haired dog isn't she
Well I certainly gave it to him
Kristine said an English Pointer showed up on her doorstep and she's trying to find her a good home
I told her to let me know if she doesn't find anyone but we travel so much
It is yours
I never said it would last
If fact it is a tribute to Enron that that era is over
You've earned the right to doubt my credibility based on your original interview however
Really I think you will
I'll keep it to myself
I think having a list is a sign of progress
I fix up the form for you as well
I may be in trouble
If you know a problem could arise just let me know and I'll hang around
That is my job even though I kid about not being a morning person
I'll send it to you when I get it
Yes thank you so much
It is displayed proudly in my office
Here is the letter I mentioned
Our goal is to fax it to the Village later this afternoon if possible
I will be out of town but I think you should definitely be there
I'll mention it to Sheila
Please put this on your calendar and plan to attend
Not to rush you but do you have an estimate of when you will have completed your review/memo
Tuesday afternoon is our best bet in NYC
Should I call and set up a meeting or what
I'm glad she sounds so good
Maybe she can be a back up for next Thursday
Claudette can you please arrange the conference call and a room
Is this something I should have Heather Brown participate in
Are you available to participate
I'm not sure what is on the agenda but I thought I should check your availability
Vlady - here are some thoughts on your comments
Let me know if this is practical
I couldn't remember if I forwarded this to you so here 'tis
As far as I'm concerned you have answered my legal questions
However this doesn't seem like a big issue to me
Please forward it to them for me
We sent Mitsui a draft of that assignment agreement some time ago but they have not yet responded
Kathleen Kay tells me that you are the keeper of change orders
Thanks in advance for your input
I understand there is some urgency with getting this out
Have you heard from Sara
Guess I could walk over there and look
Thanks for getting me the ISDA docs on Friday
Doesn't look like this will apply to you
Maybe you will beat me to it which is fine by me
We will get it next time
Angie please print both attachemenst and this e-mail for me
You know how it goes with juniors
Hope you have had a good week
He was to call if he didn't catch fish
I'm glad you found something interesting to do
Let me know if you meet anybody famous
I found it difficult to summarize what Enron does and what kind of opportunities it has for college grads
Any wisdom you have on the subject would be appreciated
I know your husband must be overjoyed to have you back
His gain is our loss but I understand completely
I have been back in Mexico for a month
I just started working in a media/entertainment company in Mexico it is quite a different world but very interesting
I am working in the finance department working primarily in valuation of new investments
I hope everythis is excellent!
Well if you are ever in Mexico please let me know
Your changes to the letter look fine to me
Are we ready to go with this one
Hope you all have no objections
Please advise is there are any changes you want made
Would you believe I don't know how late the maid stays
I think on most Tuesdays she comes in the afternoon but beyond that I really don't know
I don't know if Paige will be here still but she might
We have your Anniversary present here,also part of neil's Birthday
Isn't that the day she works
How late does she stay
I'll be in on Monday although I have a heavy conference call schedule
I tried to calling you on your phone but it does not seem to bew working right
Keep the PPA has streamlined as possible putting as much as we can in the interconnection agreement
We should pick a term define it and use it throughout
A little unclear to me
I'll send her an electronic copy also
Please feel free to call me with any questions or comments
Thanks and talk with you shortly
I leave tomorrow and will be back on Thursday
When are you going out of town
Kay I believe that this is the most recent version
Lee check the dates to make sure they are right
I think you had it last
I can't seem to find it either
I think this is at least close to the final draft
It ain't pretty but it seemed to work
I am so sorry to hear about Annie
Did it break in a different place
Thanks for having him
He is just crazy for her
We were real proud of him
Hope Paige made it home for your great meal
Wanted you to know Annie rebroke her right arm yesterday
I'm not sure why they wait until to decide
Unless needed we will be here until Saturday
I just received the EOBs back on Sharon Seals
Did you RSVP for me as well
I calendared this the other day when Sheila's came
I'm way ahead of you
Please call if you need anything else
By the way I have the original contracts in my office
Feel free to call her though
I ate all vegetables for lunch but then I had a third cookie
Annie broke her arm again and may have to have surgery
I guess you won't want any dinner tonight
That's ok that means more chicken for me
She could drop him off and I could pick him up
Do you want me to call her
I did remind him that today is a Mary Lou day
He wants Paige to pick him up but I don't know how that could work
I think it just changes my seat assignment
Dental is also covered if we have any uncovered dental expenses
I could stand some new glasses also
Got a card we can send Annie
This may not be the most up-to-date version of the Fuel Cell Team Contact List but its a start
Please call me about this
Let's talk about it tomorrow
I would contact Kathy Clark
I need to get a good read on what CO number we are up to etc
Hope things are well with you
Jody can you assist again
Sorry but I will be in Las Vegas again until next Wednesday
Did you get these
Please find two presentations attached for your information
The second presentation is our standard presentation on fair value investments
We must hang together less we hang separately
Thanks for looking out for us
I believe that this is the most recent version
I need details
And he had such pretty wavey hair
I believe his title is a vice president
If so who will sign it for ENA
I will send it to you if I do of course
Again I have to check my emails
Doesn't look so timely when we keep back dating documents
I am very confused with Change Order Numbers also
Any others on the horizon that you know of
Please print and add to my Fuel Cell book
Do we have a redline copy showing GE's comments
If so then we need to revise the CO accordingly
Sorry I wasn't here to take you to lunch
If not can you point me toward someone who might have these files
Looks like we might have some business
I have forwarded your draft of the turbine document to GE but have not had any comments
How is your schedule tomorrow or Monday
I would however suggest that Kent review the summary not for accuracy but for content prior to posting
Are you available any time soon
Do you have lunch plans
Additionally OEC's internal procedures and methods will dictate when you cut in your chain of command
Could you please get me some post it notes various sizes cool colors preferred
I'm still in my conference call
You'll get her figured out
Please call if you have questions/comments
Is it true that tomorrow is your birthday
You did better than I did
Oh well it just goes to show you that it is all a state of mind
I wish Carlos was here to do a lot of this though
Is that the same for you too
Why don't you try feeding her again at night
Maybe she will sleep better
I feed Jack twice a day and he is still skinny as a stick
Isn't she on the thin side anyway
I'll try to make you a list while you are gone
She may fuss at first but she will love it
Crating her will calm her down
I believe the Pointer Rescue people agree
I bet the neighbors are just loving us
I'll call you though
Please let me know of any comments
Hope you trip was a success
I'm not sure what we mean by EPC contract
Is this referring to the Fuel Cell document we are working now or is there to be another layer
He expects one EPC contract and we had tried to leave room for multiple contracts
Also are we planning to mark up the fuel cell contract to recover our fee
Barbara here is the document I discussed concerning some of the Chicago stuff
Jeff I don't know if you have received this from Gregg all ready
I've given blood at MD Anderson before and I think they will have the blood type information on file
If anyone else is in the same boat you call the number below and ask for Barbara
I couldn't reach her today because it is Saturday but they tell me she will be in on Monday
If all goes well I could be in business fairly quickly
I don't know if you got this so here 'tis
If that is possible try to send them by Tuesday
I understand completely
Nothing can get to you like your kid in pain
My oldest also had a lot of ear infections and it seemed to be painful
But she out grew the problem
My apologies again for not getting back to you on Friday
Talk to you on Monday
To briefly answer your questions we are contemplating another layer of documents with the EPC contract
Also we've told Bob Wright that if the plants don't work the state gets its money back
The Development Agreement will cover our fee
So no our fee is not at risk for the fuel cells failing to perform
As I mentioned I'm still working away on the revised equipment contract
Kay can we use your office
Could we handle the CRRA LOI at the same time
It would help me get finished with the FCE doc
I'm sure you saw that GE and Honeywell are merging
I wonder if that makes ONSI a part of GE
I have most of these I think
Could you let us know
Bob sorry to hear about the doctor and the impact it must have had on Michael
I'll let him know
Should we let Marty know about this
Mitch is his client
Jim and Betty Boyd sat behind us at the wedding
Mauricio and his wife were there and showed no signs of leaving
I wonder how late it went
Let me know if it reschedules
Did you change jobs
What do you hear from Ben
Anthony called me last week just to chat
I had such a great time in New Orleans
Mrs T told me Turner's wedding was a spectacular
Hey - tell that St Francis boy of yours - Roger - to quit throwing broken bats
Did you hear Candy is moving to Holland
I didn't know she was married until I saw her
I'm thinking you don't have anything to move
Anyway I guess I should be flattered that I am such a coveted asset
It's a bit like a pushing a rock you can only move so much each day
To keep you in the loop
If none would you let the group know so we can get it out to WLB and Tim
Please let me know if you aren't available
Do you want to generate one just like the rest
Thanks for getting back to me Kay
When can we expect a draft of the ABB facility agreement
Sheila mentioned that Mitch is one of your guys
He is going to get in touch with Kent for me
Hope your trip is going well
It is just us chickens Gregg's agenda
I'm looking forward to speaking with you
All CA's are processed through Kay Young as she maintains the data base
Kay could you point Kathleen to the repository of the forms so that she can generate the first draft
I need some language regarding audit rights but this should get you started
I'll get the draft working but it would probably be a good idea to discuss this a bit
Message Is this your deal
Legal notice Trade names trademarks registered trademarks and service marks are the property of their respective owners
Also please prepare a transmittal letter to Heather for me to sign
Call me on my cell if you need anything
I spoke to Lee Johnson yesterday about all the change orders and a couple of outstanding issues
If this is a problem please let me know
Please let me know if you have any changes or comments
Here are my suggestions/comments on Rev
Does it matter
You should have it today
As I recall you were going to turn another draft of the GE facility agreement deleting the WestLB references
Peter Thompson is working on it
Let me know if Michael needs more
I'll have your family in my thoughts and prayers
Can we adjust the time of the GE call
I have a feeling that Roger's presentation is the generic mark-to-market stuff but I could be wrong
A & K really dropped the ball on that one although I wish I had expedited them more
I still haven't heard from Kent despite email voice mail and calling Lee
I hope he is ok because being non-responsive is not Kent's style at all
I heard it increases their size by a third
See you didn't miss it after all although we had Herman and David
Please let me know if you are aware of any others
Can you send me a copy of a professional service agreement
I need to prepare one
Thanks for your patience on this issue
Last I heard GE had signed it and would send it to me
I look forward to talking with you all then
Something I can put on the list and take off
Shall I send it directly to Tracy
Kay - I have an easy one for the list
Tracy Irvin our accounting support would like a copy for her workpapers
I thought you would enjoy this
Parks a business professor I have had but do not have right now
Then she said it's do-able for you of course
PLease let me know what you think
I'll get back to you later today
I know I owe you a phone call
Please email me your number and I'll give you a call
I can't believe I've forgotten it
So how are you doing with the EECC changes
Hope it is going well out there
Fortunately I have most of what I need to get a draft of the equipment contract turned
I'll email it later
I'm home with my sick son this am
Do you have a sense for the appropriate time period here
Do you think that this difference is enough
On assignment they mentioned a corporate guaranty
Do we want an option to have them store these which would then impact payment
Don't forget you can reach me by email
Maybe it is viral
He ate a good breakfast but he is getting quieter
Thanks for teaching me
I am flexible today
I know you will be driving from SA
Now it's time for me to be off to the land of playdough crayons and snotty faces
I just got through to the Attendance line
I will leave a voice mail for Ms Norris
I'll forward a couple more I need faxed
Please print and fax to me at home
I am not certain on the other guarantee points
Have you forwarded to ENSR
There is probably a time period you can do this
I have one minor question
Is the Notice to Proceed Effective Date a set date or is it x days following y event
Scott I've printed off your emails and will incorporate your input
That lets me massage it review my notes and perhaps even read it
I hope to speak to Jeff and Heather this morning
Lets hold sending FCE a copy until I have that call
I'm getting ready to take Michael to the pediatrician so it depends on how long that takes
I'll find the instructions and email them to you
Will Scott and Rose be joining you
I catch up with you later today
I know what it is
I'm familiar with the people and the contractual terms at issue and will be happy to discuss it
Could you please fax this to Heather
Here's a form of LOI we can use
We can call her after our meeting or before if you have the time
In that case we may want to use an LLC instead of messing with an assignment later
I am very interested in your insight concerning possible structures and what we need to keep in mind
Do we need a procedure
I think that FCE agreed to this concept
I thought that FCE agreed
In fact both Michael and I have strep throat and spent the day at home
Will you have the house ALL to yourself
I just talked to Carlos
They had their meeting today with the EES group and what can I say
Since Carlos told me that you are his exclusive head hunter can I be the mingling coordinator
By the way I think I am taking Friday off okay
SZ really grows on you doesn't he
I am encouraging him to get a hunting lease
I still haven't done anything with the Confidentiality doc
When I found that I almost fell out of my chair laughing
Take care of you and your little man
Perhaps we will get some input from our team in Conn gang by noon
PS I can now print at home
I can't wait to hear how it went in Danbury
Whether its tomorrow or Friday I think to maintain schedule that we will need to get the draft P.O
If not then I want to send the P.O
I'm glad you wrote as I was going to write you
He is on two antibiotics which he takes twice a day
I'm trying to figure out how to get these to you since these have to be refrigerated
Obviously if Michael isn't doing great I won't go
Currently he feels fine and only feels bad when he has fever
Just let me know if you aren't comfortable with the situation
I can always leave on Saturday or not at all
He is watching me type this
Michael asked me for advice yesterday
He just doesn't think it will be long enough
No problem as far as I am concerned
He hasn't left yet but I'll remind him
Michael gets his school picture taken tomorrow
She did our first family portrait after Michael was born
Sorry for the delay in getting this to you
I thought I'd send this along
However he did suggest a couple slight revisions to protect Enron's interests
Therefore I need to know ASAP if there are any problems with the draft as written
Otherwise I will be sending it to Peoples as our final revision by mid morning
I have a fax machine at home though if you prefer
Which do you prefer
Are you in the office to initial signature pages today
I know that Jeff is in Portland
I can print it here initial it and fax it to whomever you want
She is very conscientious about what she signs and who initials what
Where and to whom do you want it faxed
Since it will be Janet signing it will probably be better to have the initials on the pages first
Let me know which is easier and we can coordinate
I'm working on it now
That way we can get it to them in time for weekend review
I spoke briefly to Jeff
Here is what I believe to be the resolution
Can we delete the confidentiality article
Is it commercially important to restore the langauge on displacement deliveries
I look forward to discussing this with you at your convenience
I can do that
Michael probably won't be at school tomorrow unless he really perks up quickly
Do you think there would be a problem with that
Any idea when and where I should take him
Maybe I can leave on Saturday
By the way did they ever get the acknowledgments taken care of
I spoke to the doctor again today and he said that Michael had a pretty good bit of strep
I have not forgotten about it though
How are you and handsome doing
I'll give him his sixth dose of medicine in a minute
I just can't take him to school until he is better
Once the medicine kicks in he will bounce back quickly
He hasn't gotten better but I have
I haven't decided whether I'm taking Michael
If he is feeling better I'll leave him with his sitter Charlotte
Sorry it didn't work out with girls but I understand
I changed the plant stuff around swapping most of them for Facility
I think it is a bit more clear now
Let me know what else needs to be done
Also we have not yet completed a full internal review of the document
However so that we can hold our conference call today I am sending you the draft
Please give me a call to arrange the conference call
It is hard to get deals done at Enron which as shareholders we should probably be glad
I guess it is time to call the doctor again
But alas the world will never know of my comedic brilliance
As you are aware Joe Sutton has left Enron
Your names will be published as winners of the contest but we won't be able to show the list
If you don't get your certificate by the end of next week please let me know
Thanks again for your fabulous entries
Who was able to do it
I can't really complain since he rarely travels
However he is welcome to pamper upon his return
I understand that you and Michael are sick with strep throat
Sorry I lost my temper
No reason to lose my temper though
Can I send the last version of the red-lined P.O
I don't know about any other strategies can you trade water
You'll be happy to know that it didn't take long
You might want to request ComparRite just in case it comes up again
I attended Sing
I enjoyed the performances of the various groups which were within the bounds of what I expected
Unfortunately I am not writing to tell you how much I enjoyed it
The act was beyond offensive it was criminal especially in light of the young children present
Again I urge you to not view this as an act of youthful indiscretion
I'm checking your desk for pom-poms
I believe we've covered all the issues outlined by Sandra
Do not hesitate to call me for any reason whatsoever
Carlos you have much wisdom for such a young buckeroo
I must say that all of them look pretty well serious
Kinda Gore-like you know
I was out sick Wed-Fri but now I'm back
I was out ill
I didn't get your fax last week
I was out sick so I didn't call Shirley
I haven't talked to Paige about her schedule yet but I know we need to get organized
Also I think Michael is out of school that Wednesday
Again I need to check
I know that is hard to believe
I assume Michael is out of school Thursday-Sunday but don't know
I would love to get him interested in things like this
That's what he wants
I would try to sneak in reading a book or looking over something but he was emphatic
Let me know about Beauty and the Beast
See you tonight to trick or treat
Well once again I'm messed up on my calendar
I was home with Michael three days last week - we both had strep but he was worse
I did make it to Georgetown and had a nice time with Paige
Otherwise it was great
Paige did really well and she was front and center for most of their act
I don't know what we are going to do about Thanksgiving
Neil and I are negotiating
I neglected to discuss it with Paige this weekend of course
Michael and I are both better although he didn't get better until Friday night
Are you staying at the bed and breakfast
Are you and Michael feeling better
The address for you looks odd
The email was sent last night with no indication that it did not go through
I will resend PLUS attach the documents to this reply
They have received it but not opened it yet
What does your schedule look like Wednesday am
Kay could you check Heather's availability
I suspect I'll hear from him this am
Kinda spooky since they are a technology driven company
Thanks now we have it
I'm not sure I understand it
I'm clearing some other stuff off my desk so I can get to this hopefully this afternoon
After being on vacation for four days I can't remember why I did or didn't do what
See our full election coverage
Also I think enovate should sign at CA
Could you please review this and add the appropriate legal language
We can discuss this any time you want
The loan documents you prepared
Kay -- I just received Suzanne's e-mail re the conference call tomorrow
Do you know what it is about
I don't know the substance of the comments
Also do you have any heads-up re what the comments will be
I forgot about the fence
Can you leave early too
Well we will not have a fence today
Bottom line he didn't have the equipment to do either job
He got there before me and watched Jack a little bit
A fast learner as he put it
Anyway I am waiting for them to call me and will let you know what I hear
I know he is leaving early himself
Write if you can
Kathleen will be bringing it to you if she hasn't all ready
I don't know how we want to staff the meeting yet but I do want to check your availability
How does that date look for you
Sheila may have someone she wants to work on it
If not I can fit it in since it relates to what I'm working on with the GE contracts
I assume ENA will then be assigning the equipment on to the project company or EPC contractor also
Sorry I thought Suzanne had confirmed it
I can call you
I also told her you would call her
I don't know the status
Kay/Dave could one of you send the form to me and let me know the big picture status
I don't remember this one
Lets keep him happy
Kathleen could you please get with Rusty or Fred to see what's up
He has a head cold so he is going home to go to bed
He will sigh and moan and carry on like you wouldn't believe
Neil called and he sounds like he feels awful
Kathleen and I have already discussed this today
If he prefers to have whoever will be doing the drafting that's fine too
He said he needed to prepare for the meeting
He hasn't read the contract so if it's regarding same he needs to know
Let me know and I'll call him
Do you prefer his presence or would a call work
It just came in so I haven't reviewed it
I'll get back to you with the location
Please print the blackline for me
I see Ben keeps calling me
Tell him I'll be on for another hour
He went into your voice mail
I believe I can help Lisa with this information at least confirming some of the stuff for her
Your list is very close to mine
I'm making a list as I go back through the draft so I'll update when I get through
I looked through the exhibit package that you sent me
I have highlighted the exhibits that believe that we definitely need
I also listed some other potential exhibits
What are your thoughts on our specific requirements
Please let me know if you have any suggestions or comments
This looks like it belongs in the specs
What do we mean by configuration
When you have the draft P.O
I will leave my schedule fairly open today
I'm on a conference call or I would have called
Kay do you generally attend these meetings
Please at your convenience give me a shout
Kathy and I discussed your comments and she is making changes to the contract consistent with those comments
Please let me know if tomorrow am works for you
We can put them back in when you are ready
Scott/Stephen I'm trying to summarize the essence of these performance guarantees similiar to what I have for heat rate
Let me know if you want it redlined against something and if so which version
There isn't anything attached that I can open
Didn't I tell you - I love outside counsel
I had a big lunch so something light sounds good
She said it does not matter when you paid
She suggested we ask St F for a quarterly statement
Any thought on what you would like for dinner
I am also attaching the current draft of the contract
Suzanne is adding your changes to the purchase agreement now
Ok I know I must be doing something wrong
I'm using my HRonline password
I accept the terms & conditions of this Pilot Participation Agreement
I have once again called ABB but haven't heard back from them yet
I think it is a great day to work
Brenda please get me a temporary for this day
Jennifer is trying to get me a ticket to the game
But I might not even end up going to the game
And if I do go and we come back Friday then I'll come back to school Saturday or Sunday
I will be home ASAP on Tuesday that's for sure
I'll keep you posted with plans as I figure them out
I could nap in this weather
Please call me to discuss so we can him with response
Please confirm that the limitations I included are acceptable
I'll send the blackline when I get it
I apologize for the delay in getting this document to you
I haven't heard of any problems
As requested I went the abbreviated route
Have you noticed that almost all my documents are monsters
I believe I was told Richmond
If the meeting goes forward do you know what city it will be in
I believe this to be blacklined against the original document
Anyway I thought the change of name from enovate to enervate is priceless
Kay Jordan has asked me to take a look at this
Please contact me Monday morning to discuss
I got a draft of the CA from her this am
I'll give it a look and get it to you today
I just knew you guys got rain the entire weekend
I'm glad it worked out ok
I tried calling last night but got a busy signal
Lisa tells me they may be heading your way on Saturday
I haven't been out of town since our anniversary so it must be time to go again
Hope you are enjoying the pretty weather today
I can sure see along way today
We hope you did not get washed or blown away yesterday
Would you believe it didn't rain here until last night
Every thing worked out great with our company
They could fish again after we got home
I forgot to tell you we sent money to Michael's school
They will put his name plate in it
So of course we sent Paige some money also
Do you know your Thanksgiving plans yet
I must stop so you can go back to work
Mary Lynn Ruffner has been involved but to my knowledge has not reviewed the documents
If Sarah doesn't have a copy of the LLC agreement I can get you one
I've seem a preliminary DASH but I don't know where it sits now
Therefore I do not think that Enron should protest or intervene
I should have sent this to you as well
I'm just about half done with the chart so I thought I would share it with you for comment
This doesn't have the latest from what you sent
Please call him
I can call him if you want me to
She's making them now
We have an additional item we did not discuss today
Jackie Please draft appropriate language for the agreement and include it in the latest draft of the agreement
I hope I didn't open a can of worms
As you know the request for Ben came from Janet not Ben
I'll check with her
If not you can get a copy of my copy
Also I will work on getting Gregg signing authority re his message below
Mark H looks like he came out great
He is anxiously awaiting your return from NY
Could you please print this and put in a big binder
Let's meet at your convenience
As a retired trial lawyer I prefer saying less whether than more
I'll bring the letters down and we can discuss specifics
I don't know if our group needs anyone but I wanted to pass this resume along
I worked with Carlos when I was at EECC and I rate him highly
As an added bonus he is fluent in Spanish
He discussed this with Vicky so she is aware that he is checking out opportunities here
I thrive on pressure
Is that close to her due date
I don't know numerical addresses just cross streets
Hope it lasts a couple of days
Neil loves his pig
I don't think he has picked a place for it yet though
Hope you didn't mind the pig
If not can we include that in this CA or should we have a separate CA for audit
Attached are the drafts of CA's for enovate for your review
I know the feeling
I'm not sure Paul will be joining us but Peter has confirmed
If we are delayed we'll let them know
How long did you reserved the line
I don't have their names so I figured you'd call them when you were ready for them
Please review the attached and give me a call
Could you review from a legal standpoint
I'll give it a look
Would it be possible for you to mark up the list of comments highlighting which are outstanding
I just opened it
Just to be safe I am resending to all of you
Do you think it fits with the possible structures
I am happy to access the resources in their group however
It was something I pulled together for you to look at
In fact I think assignment by them should require our consent
Why would this apply if it were only rights
Have you run it by them
The most likely scenario is this so we should make certain that it can happen under the agreement
I don't have a problem with not back dating it
Attached are GE's comments which I just received
They are concerned that we tried to improve the contract
I wasn't trying to play games
I was only joking
Where am I moving
Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move
FYI I expect to be on vacation that week
I would really like to stay where I am if possible
I like being close to Suzanne not to mention the good neighbors and the benefit of facing the wall
This transaction is on Dave D and Janet D's radar screen and Mark is familiar with it
We also have to move transformers into this facility so I have been in contact with ABB concerning same
After it has been signed please send me a copy for my files
Thank you for the timely comments
Please let me know what else I can do
Thanks for your call the other day
The team is currently focused on getting the funding approved as you can see from the attached
Also we have had some discussions with Fuel Cells about the contract to purchase the equipment
Therefore we need to have BOTH dogs put up tomorrow and the gate open
The work will NOT be done that day as far as I know
If we have a hope of leaving town the week of Thanksgiving we need a reservation at the kennel
Do we have one yet
I would say we might want one Fri and Sat night
Do you have a new ETA yet
I need to manage expectations on this end
Do I pick this up at drop off
If I can get the clean version I'm happy to run a blackline here
Maybe getting out of your system would help
I was told it would only be a few more minutes
I don't have a preference as to who is doing what just want to make sure we're all coordinated
Again I apologize for the delay
As you can see the blackline has deleted certain section headings and internal section cites
Please let me know your thoughts about participating in the process
When do you think we will have a pretty compared document
Here are letters to Westinghouse as revised to reflect our comments
I got lots done Saturday but I can't remember what
I bought a few Christmas presents which felt good
Jack ran off during the worst part of the storm scaring Neil and I horribly
A neighbor brought him back
We are having an electronic fence installed soon so I hope that will help
Sorry I can't get organized
Hope you are enjoying better weather today
Uncle Bob was so glad to see them
We enjoyed their visit
Did you get any shopping done this week end
Did you have a bad storm at your house last night
I thought I had sent it out on Friday but I had just saved it as a draft
Any idea what time it starts
Looks like they have a rats nest to figure out
I apologize but it is still wrong
I am desperately atempting to get this straightened out
Otherwise we can just agree to all of GE's suggested changes and call it a day
Once again I apologize for the extended delay
Some strange things happened when I restarted my computer
I chose ok which was my only option
I'm obviously on it now so we'll see how it goes
Please be sure that your data files are backed up
Does that work for re-imaging my machine
By the way how long does it take
If it takes less than an hour then you can have it anytime today
Have you seen or do you recall this invoice
If so would you happen to know where I might find a copy
Do we have a good clean copy
If so please re-send it to me along with the best of blacklines
The automatic numbering is off but it does show the changes made to the text
I again apologize for the delay in getting a workable blackline
Were you looking for someone else
I know it is short but I thrive on lists
Does it mean that payments must be current for the guaranty etc to be acceptable
Could you send that portion of the contract to her
GE is on board and I think the final breakout contract should be completed this week
I think that's it
Mike Sandridge and I finally spoke on the phone
Are you going to get a Palm Pilot
I have a meeting with ABB for Thursday
I will take care of getting Bill's signature
Thank you both for your assistance
Any questions or comments let me know
Kathy do you have anything to add
That may be about it but I don't trust my memory
I think they are also known as Hungarian pointers but vizsla is the official AKC name
What kind of dog did you say you have
I emailed Jeff and told him what I'm up to today by the way
Please advise if you have any changes or comments
Last time I checked I didn't have a fax from you
Did it go through
Sorry our schedules aren't lining up too well
My question is will these items be purchased direct by NEPCO or will we add onto the existing contract
In the meantime I look forward to when we can meet
If you have any time today or tomorrow I could rearrange my schedule to accodate yours
Here's my list of comments to the most recent draft
It is subject to internal review but this gives you an idea
Meant to copy you
I talked with Westinghouse this morning
If the changes reflect what they described on the phone then we'll be ready to sign tomorrow morning
Mike are you in tomorrow to sign
Dale can you forward it to the Kay and I to look at and consider
I'll forward them on the Westinghouse by e-mail first
I received a call from Herb yesterday afternoon
Also I told him that we expected additional comments on the exhibits today
I'm unfamiliar with the individual project requirements so I'm asking your help
I know the ESA project has some time sensitivity as well
I left Kent a message suggesting that we start with COA telling him ENA is the assignee
I'll let you know when I hear from him
Just as we discussed
Are they still available
Maybe it is Lisa Alfaro
If you prefer that an ENA lawyer handle it I will volunteer
Am I the deal lawyer for the ESA turbines
I'll see what I can do to get his attention
Bless you if you could get the breakout contract done
Sorry I had to miss lunch
Did Dan bake his blueberry or cranberry bread
Has the payment allocation chart been updated and if so could I get a copy
From what I can tell here the ESA and City of Austin deals are the most time sensitive
If we need Ben it will need to be after noon eastern
Let me know how many games you're in for
Neil and I discussed this last night
I'll check with him and get back to you
I haven't forgotten you
I never would have guessed smoked oysters
I don't mind it too much although by Sunday we may be stir crazy
We went to Michael's school on Wednesday as his class was singing in chapel
He is a really big guy much bigger than I thought
I see why Piazza didn't take a swing
I have deleted it from the LV contract
What is your availability for a conference call with GE today
Let me know when you are available this afternoon
I haven't heard from GE yet today
Is your cell phone still the best way to contact you
After that I will be negotiating the Las Vegas sale
How do we look for a conference call today
Kathy Clark is preparing a redline for your use and you should have it shortly
Have I forgotten to address any questions or comments
Can you be the point person on collection of this information
I tried to figure out how to print the whole thing but failed
Did she figure out how to print the entire document
It really has a lot of information on it
Do you have the missing info
If not I can send it to you
I wanted to pass along the resume of Carlos Sole
Carlos and I worked together extensively at EECC
I can recommend Carlos as a solid intelligent hard working lawyer
Got your voice mail and it reminded me to sent this out
I don't know what is up with Jeff so why wait to send this
I'm having lunch with Dan today - want to join us
For the recitals what is the kW capacity of its plant and where is the plant located
Are these still the dates we are using
I don't think you need to do anything re Enron South America as Rob Taylor is working on that
Were you asking about ENA
I don't know who is preparing all the exhibits as I'm waiting to hear from GE
Dan just dumped me so we can go any where you want
Eric these are already in my list that I sent you
You'll like it
Do you want to meet by the garage
Fox Diner as it's peaked my curiosity
As for payments we can state that as of the signing of the agreements all payments have been made
Sounds ok to me
If so I need its place of incorporation and location of its ofices
As to the exhibits I believe most can be copied
Would you mind checking on this
That Paul has a cloud over him
At least he has time to heal before baseball season
Neil and I will stay at the B & B
He was with the Mayor of Palacios and his grandson
Yes and I agree
I will review the redlined document tonight
Will that work with your schedule
Please print and put with other stuff you just printed
I will read it again tonight
I am picking up Michael
I hope she can make it too
I thought she was coming home on Tuesday not Wednesday
Allow yourself a day to pack
She thought it was so cute
He wants her to visit at the school but she hasn't told me whether she can make it
I had lunch with Carlos - and ate too much
I need to get focused on my diet again
Sounds good but I thought you wanted a pickup
I did the walk through with John and Maria this morning
His loss your gain
I don't think it will be signed until next week
If you see anything else you would like changed please let me know as well
To avoid this it is important to meet with the staff early on and resolve their concerns informally
I'm off to walk my dog
I'm doing some stuff for Gregg Penman this am but it isn't too bad
Paige will be home in time to go to lunch and Michael wants her to come visit his school
I have not yet received any response from Eric Boyt
Looks like the changes are relatively minor but I feel better
Please contact us if there are any other questions
I don't think this changes any substance but I defer to you
I think that is all I changed
I also added a quick intro
Neither may be necessary let me know
Thanks again for your help on your vacation day
I like the changes
So did I get moved
I actually prefer to do it myself anyway
Hope you have a great Thanksgiving
Are we ready or do we need this for a swap for something
I'm looking through the warranty section now so perhaps we can discuss that as well
Kay I don't have a copy of the GE contract so I can't look at the sections referenced below
I'll forward you the latest email on that topic
Unfortunately I bought her something already which is highly unusual for me
Hope you are enjoying all your guys
How many places should I set at the table tomorrow
I hope you are just having a nice day to yourself
The contract with GE is not quite finished although it is close
I hope to have a conversation with GE today regarding finishing this document including the exhibits
For the recitals the kW capacity of its plant and the location of the plant
Will it specifically be ENA or an ENA subsidiary
Can you review and advise
I was out on vacation last week so I just now received this
PS It was great seeing you guys last week
I suggest that we address any commercial financial or legal issues outstanding concerning the assignment of these turbines
Yep that looks like it about covers it
Any chance we will get any kind of sign-off on the consent do you think
He's in my thoughts so I appreciate the info
I have a conflict Wed afternoon
But can catch up on Thurs with you and Kent
Meanwhile please send me an e-copy of the LM Exhibits
I can do a quick redline of those that change
Left everything for you in the closet in the bedroom
Dad took it out
I called Cher
Luiz - are you in SP or Rio today
I made some revisions to the language Rose proposed
I deleted the references to changing any delegation of rights/obligations
Can you dig up Peter Thompson's number for me
Here's what I have for an electronic file of the exhibits
We'll spare you extra emails until then
I saw that you posted about getting a nanny
I've used two services but only one that I can suggest
For my last nanny I used Morningside Nanny Service or something close to that
They seemed thorough and found us a wonderful person
I've also used River Oaks Nanny but they sent me a nut case
I didn't make any changes to the exhibits but Paul had early on
I'll make sure you get the most recent draft
I think this is the most current version
I think this looks great
With the rep letter language I would ship it to Barnas Shoemaker and Swift
If they want they can add in the more specific ones - ya think
I am forwarding the serial numbers for those turbines
I forgot to send this to you
We have developed a preliminary draft of the LOI which I am attaching for your review
I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss it with you to get your input etc
If so do you have the serial numbers to the last two ones
I had a computer malfunction and lost your email
Could you please resend it
Please carry on in my absense
I will be on the call tomorrow
Let me know if you have questions in the meantime
Do you want to get together a few minutes early tomorrow to discuss indemnity/LOL etc
Of course it is a good thing to do at night so long as it isn't raining
Good Morning from my new office
I could not figure out where that address came from as it had been correct before
Look forward to talking to you later
Please call so that we can discuss
Here's what I think we should have on the ESA exhibits
Let's see if it will hunt
Since you both asked the same question I thought I would send an email
You do it their way
I haven't thought through it all but these issues probably need to be considered
Otherwise we run the risk of having a dispute with them later about any problems or damage
I don't have it on me
I know Neil's boss and his boss' boss will have parties
Are those good days for you
When you have a chance please send me Michael's Social Security number
Please take some shopping time and I look forward to keeping Michael for the parties
I had seen the cleaning woman several times
I handed in my paper leaving the last question blank
Just before class ended one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade
They deserve your attention and care even if all you do is smile and say 'hello'
I also learned her name was Dorothy
Her car had broken down and she desperately needed a ride
Soaking wet she decided to flag down the next car
The man took her to safety helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi cab
She seemed to be in a big hurry but wrote down his address and thanked him
To his surprise a giant console color TV was delivered to his home
The rain drenched not only my clothes but also my spirits
Then you came along
Because of you I was able to make it to my dying husband's bedside just before he passed away
God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others
A waitress put a glass of water in front of him
After much pushing and straining he finally succeeded
The peasant learned what many of us never understand
Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition
Then his face grew pale and his smile faded
This is from my daughter
At the risk of sounding like a wimp I may just go home after my hair apptment
I can work from there just as well as I can from here only in my jammys
You know since I got off the allergy shots I've been feeling a whole lot better
He's driving himself crazy
They need to give him some meds to calm him down
I don't blame you for wanting to go home
I know where to find you if I need you
I think so too but you can't convince him of that fact
I'm calling him now
He said he'd call me if he's lost more weight
He is making himself miserable
I'm glad he decided to go to the dinner
I bet everyone there heard about all his physical issues
He just called and now his weight is back up
I told him I thought he was having anxiety
Hell I wish I could go too
Wow I didn't know I could control anything
More info for your file and use
Maybe we should consider going someplace for a couple of days sans kids
I meant a shopping date no Michael
I've always thought it was my responsibility to let me supervisor know if I'm gone not yours
I'm not usually a Galveston person but it might be worth considering in December
Might be best with Michael though so we could go to Moody Gardens and the Strand
Guess I have itchy feet
I haven't be on the road in a couple of weeks
All I see at the house is responsibility and we never do anything anyway
Please advise of any comments you might have
Here's a draft of the facility agreement for your review
PS I think I have a redline somewhere
As you recall the contract allows for us to request storage
I will send the exhibits in a few moments
Out of habit I sent this to Lisa
Here it is-welcome to the fray
Please let me know ASAP if you have any comments
They moved it a while back
I think that is the only outstanding item
Thanks for offering your previous risk memo
I accept all offers of prior work product
I believe this should be a TEH responsibility
If fact please review the confidentiality provisions in the GE agreement so that we can discuss same
Creditworthiness - looks like we may have an issue here
I'm still reviewing and collecting comments but this gives you an idea of where we are headed
We don't have any of the specifics on the site conditions so we will have to work with generics
I suspect that Coral may request language like Carolyn's version as it tracts the language in the LOI
Please call if we may be of any further assistance
I know New Orleans has deals that time of year
She will e-mail me later today or Monday with more info
How about New York if we have to fly
However none of this is etched in stone and their are active discussions with Peoples about what to do
I suspect this isn't much help
Are we in or out of the deal
I still need comments on the GE break out contract which was previously forwarded to Finance Accounting and Tax
If anyone who didn't get it would like to get it please let me know
Ok Team we are in the last throws of documentation of financing documents
If anyone has comments they need to be in before that
Since funding is required they may balk
As soon as I know something I will let you know
We won't have any site specific technical info so we will have to fly without it
I know that seems strange but there is no designated site for this equipment as of now
I would like to sign up if there's still room
Please holler if you have any comments
Please give this a look and see what you think
No news here for me but I thought you might enjoy looking at the second chart
Hope you have PowerPoint so you can open this
Frank worked every Saturday when I was at HMRP
I had another error message today
My computer is working so far just thought I would report this for future reference
It really doesn't matter to me who handles GE signature
What are your thoughts Kay
Will you be available
This is the same transaction I called you about this am
This is their proposal
But it doesn't stop there
I really like this one
If you would prefer that I fax over the certificates please let me know
Therefore the giving of the notice needs to occur after we feel certain that the Coral transaction will close
The assignment and assumption agreement have been reviewed by Rob Taylor and he thinks the agreement is fine
I will be back in the office on Thursday
I neglected to keep a hard copy
If you prefer you can just fax it back and I will send it to the ENA folks
I left a message Friday afternoon asking where it was
They sent it to me on Saturday
I left out the really bad part
You can e-mail if you prefer
Frankly I like that approach also
Could you please make that revision and resend the document
Still working it
I know who can sign for EEPC and NEPCO
I'll try to track it down
Kay and I had a conference with them this morning
Kay's redrafting the memo based on our discussion
Both parties expect to have it wrapped up by Thursday
Kay I don't know who the right POA is to sign for these entities
Where do we stand on the Westinghouse settlement letter
I visited your website and it looks wonderful
Am I begging too much
Can you mail her package tomorrow
I meant to ask today but I got home so late I didn't get things together
I put one of Michael's airplane pictures in there
If all else fails we can take Michael to Fort Worth
Cleaning and exercising were my favorite procrastination activities
We can give you guys a generous allowance to make things easier and you can drive the Lexus
Do I sound like I'm begging yet
Hope it gets there before Saturday since I know the SU post office is closed
Yes I have it
She thought she had heartburn while she was with Michael
I would really not mind taking care of Michael at all
If you can't find anyone I can ask one of my friends that isn't going to the wedding
I just got back from business law
He went out and the car was running off without paying for their gas
Company policy is not to chase them but to get their license plate
He was a few steps outside the door and the car swerved to hit him and severely injured him
So we were talking about the liability of Love's
The family had next do nothing and insurance won't cover it
We discussed it for about fifteen minutes and several of us said Love's should be liable
That man was my son-in-law and those kids are my grandkids
I think I'm going to get him a card or something
Anyway that's the class I just got back from
Well I say book all three nights if the cancellation policy is ok and let's go for it
Which nights do they have
I will call and make reservations after checking the cancellation policy
What days do you want or should we wait to hear back from Paige
I haven't read this yet
It has been signed by ABB but not Enron but it is agreed
I'll get a copy and send it to you
Adding a material adverse effect clause - Lisa/Rose I paraphrased on this
I have ZERO pride in authorship
I don't have it in Word- just WordPerfect
See attached for our changes
I have not seen it yet
I've roughed out a document for you to discuss
I'm very excited about our vacation
I thought it would be handy to have the file
I believe all of these features are significantly beneficial to Allegheny
Please ask Allegheny for feedback as we will be entering into the agreement by the end of the week
I really appreciate your responsiveness
Can I get that by the end of the day
Let it fly
Is ther anything I can do for you
I don't remember
We are selling the equity in CA to Coral so I call it by that name
Are we not saying the same thing
I don't see why the buyer would need the redacted information other than curiosity
This E-mail is a follow-up to our telephone discussion today
If the agreements are not signed we will provide the signature pages under separate cover
If this is not satisfactory please let me know
None of us are as smart as all of us
We need to make sure we exercise the necessary sensitivity and respect while dealing with Ms Nordstrom
Let me know on the timing of preparing this draft
Doesn't it feel good to delegate
I haven't heard anything from Dave
Could I call him directly
I haven't looked at this yet but I wanted to get it to you
More Coral stuff I haven't read
Karen Jones and Sheila are working it and I haven't seen a recent draft
I believe we also want to address an issue regarding assignment but we are still discussing Mike's version internally
If you would like to discuss any of this in the am please give me a call
I need to addressee's name
What a great addition to my day
You have my proxy
Please let Anthony know what you think
If you want more than one deer your welcome to it
How do you want it processed
I can try
I believe that will streamline the process
If there is anything I can do let me know
Sorry but due to three closings next week I can't be sure I won't be working this Saturday
Your participation is essential to the success of our Programs
This approach has been discussed with Lee Johnson at GE and he is fine with it
This week saw EnronOnline celebrate its first birthday
Is this the same thing we were working on
Pursuant to our discussions attached is a copy of the revised letter for Peoples
Please look over the attached and let me know your comments
Maybe we should ask Nancy her opinion as well
Kay what is your opinion on the strength of our argument with VEPCO
Doctor do we have a pulse
It may be the death of me but we're going to build that peaker
Can you give an opinion
I'll give you the short version
I want to hear what M Cash said and who else you are meeting with
Maybe I can lay some ground work
Who is the labor lawyer that you guys use and do they do plaintiff's work
I've had a couple of people ask me for referrals and I don't know what to tell them
I just got the original you sent me yesterday
I wonder how they picked that as opposed to something else
Can we meet on this today
Do you want alot of any one item say hamburger
Are we going to split a pig with John this year
I saw you didn't get these
Accordingly there may be some addition comments from our side
I feel very flattered that she invited me
Surely it isn't Amway
Hope to see you all
My house will be on your left
There isn't one up here I looked yesterday
I looked anyway on this floor
I just sent out an email regarding the location
Didn't see any thing more but let's let Kent get back with his comments if any further
Please tell Mike that I'm on a conference call but can step out if he wants to come up
Obviously I'm in my office
Please call him and tell him
Please call me about this when you can
That's what happens when I'm not working from my list
Could you email me the MOU we are terminating
I will double check with our legal/tax/finance folks [Bill can you comment on this
I can get access on Monday
If you have other names and addresses in mind let me know
I should have that tomorrow
You win a little you lose a little
Too bad-Coral liked it a lot
Attached is the D&B report you requested for Coral Energy
I just cannot express how wonderful this sounds
I will bring signature pages tomorrow and will forward the override letter this evening
Notice how I spelled my name below
Please call me if you have any comments as I want to send it out tonight
Ok eagle eye here's the override for your one train deal
I left around midnight last night
Not too bad if you don't have to do it often
I need to deal with ABB today
Hope you are sleeping
If you have one-train plus two-trains do you have three trains
Do you need a ticket to override
I got a call from Mike and he gave me his lawyer's telephone number
Do I have the pay off number
That doesn't mean we have to but I don't want to take any chances
I was wondering if Michael has settled down or if he is having troubles attending
Today I'm going my GE's offices so I'll be in late
I won't take off all that time
That's why it is first in line
Also I'm going to try to get ABB focused on doing their facility agreements
I hope to have it this am
What is your direct line
Could you call me
I need to get the facility agreements organized and that information is obviously important
Have fun at your daughter's school
Please send it on
If you have any questions about this please get back to either myself or Ben
Thank you Paul
Please give me a call if you want to discuss
OK with you guys for me to add this
Is there a draft that we can send them
I think that the baseline should be the maximum liability amount or whatever the proper term might be
I really need to see him so please watch for my phone so it doesn't go into voice mail
I am not responsible for THIS Tribasa mess
I need the current total contract amount and the payoff amount
Please let me know if you think this would be helpful
I agree with your suggestion and will make the request to GE
I left Dave Onuscheck a voice mail about the issues and asked him to give me a call
I was going to suggest that we inbed some wiggle in the specifications but no big deal
If not can you get the word out
I know it is because I'm new to the game but I find this stuff interesting
Call me if you wish to discuss
FYI we have a conference call tomorrow to finish the binding agreement to see them the turbines
If it would work to keep them in WestLB that's great
However I want to do whatever creates the least amount of stress for you two
Just in case you don't know your efforts are very appreciated
Not just by me
Mike will provide him Frank and Dave Onuscheck a heads up
Michael and I had a great time at the zoo
I will alert Don Whaley of Coral
ENA should sign them tomorrow
Carlos is bilingual in Spanish and he conducts business in Spanish quite comfortably
Matt sorry I missed you call
I forwarded the email to GE and received no comment back
WestLB is plenty protected without it
They should get back to you very quickly with any changes
I forgot to mention something yesterday
Could you have someone give it a fatal flaw check or should I use Connecticut counsel
Can you have this verified
I only want the simplest of explanations
I now cannot locate those comments
Could you resend them
I'm including a memo from Andrews & Kurth our outside counsel who drafted the form
I left Bruce a message offering my assistance
Kay is our resident turbine expert so you should benefit greatly from her assistance
I hope so too
Hopefully it will result in Peggy's getting the relief she needs
He asked me for the comments
Kay unfortunately I deleted the comments
I will look for a hard copy
I know how to get LJM's signature
Now we need to wrap up the fun process of signatures
Resending since you didn't get it earlier
Here's the change order we would like to process today
I would line up CA next
Ben can you address that issue
I'm not sure I understand his second comment
I'll let you follow up on clarifying his second point
You may have given this to me before but I need a copy of the corporate data sheets
Brett just to let you know I am finished with Lee Johnson on this end
Kay may have additional items but it looks like you are set
I do not know if I have an electronic version
Lee/Mike do you have more copies of that document that we can attach
You are in charge of your own destiny
I am glad to hear of your strong recommendation
Michael is sick so he's at home and taking him to the doctor
I will probably stay home tomorrow
If someone can tell me which ENA lawyer worked on it I'll track it down
You'll need to do some touch-ups I believe
Let me know what other changes will be necessary
What do you mean by site specific stuff
I plan to be there
I didn't think about the champagne
I like Wick Fowler's - really easy very tasty
I just may have to have some
I don't mind a few days of cold weather
In other words the version they received has been superceded
Will we have an exhibit U
I could not fine them in that section
However I have undoubtedly missed some things and welcome any input
I revised the change order to segregate the signature page
If we aren't going to have any site specific information then I don't think we need an Exhibit U
Please print the exhibits and fax to me it home
I thought you might enjoy this one
As you know these documents are deliverables on Wednesday
I like that idea
Do we know what the guarantee is supposed to look like
Peter could you please give Suzanne the information of where to send it
Pete this will give you a full set of exhibits since you don't have everything
Suz you don't have to make a copy as I believe that copy to be an extra
I understand that Mr Dobler is out
If so Mike Miller is available to sign it
I do not know what this guarantee looks like
Michael seems to feel better but he has terrible circle under this eyes
Being a boy it isn't so bad
I think that must be his body healing
I just love Lisa she's a little bulldog isn't she
I thought this seemed like a good way to handle it
Thanks for your help Lori
In fairness to Pete we have him working on ALL the GE and ABB break out agreements at once
However I don't expect any big issues since it is so close to the original form
I'll have it to you by the end of business
Peter This should answer your questions for the final breakout
If yes incorporate it
Exhibit R - Witness Test Points...No feed back from me here
Do we get the multiple
I haven't heard anything so far although I need to check my voice mail again
Have I received a fax from ABB
I used to work at EECC so I know that noone controls that group
I haven't done any change orders under that contract
Of course I may be missing something here
I did an earlier change order to the master contract that I could forward if that would help
Could you send me a copy of your breakout C.O.
Dave predicted it would be tomorrow am
That's getting close. but if it is done by then we probably won't be subjected to bodily harm
Bear with AR and call me about Barbara
Sheila knows all she needs to know
I also made a minor change to dispute resolution
I never heard back from Dutch Bumgardner
Hope you are having a good trip
I'm guessing it is in a coma
I think he is looking good for Mexico
Did you hear from Rose on the HSR on TurboPark
However he is not a substitute for a pitcher
Rose hasn't called me yet-thanks for the intro
I think Asmus will be a good addition but we still need a good starter
Use this one as it is fine
Nit Noi sounds good to me tonight if we don't eat out of the fridge
I haven't reviewed this version yet but I wanted to get it to you asap
He is prepared to discuss line of credit/DASH at your convenience although tomorrow he is tied up with PRC
Please call him and get the correct spelling of his name his address and his fax number
I put it by the window to cool off
I've worked with three trial lawyers from K & S and they are really good
John drew a blank on the name but will call me back with the name and number
Can you check the internet and see
If not I will look in a minute
For instance they do not get the change orders or correspondence relating ot all of the turbines
Al your contract needs to be fixed up
Please contact Pete Thompson at AK in DC to get it rolling if you haven't all ready
I am dying
Can you get me a draft by Friday am
Good I didn't want to ask Ed
So which curse word did you use
It would probably be easier if Paige picked him up at the CC don't you think
Thanks for taking care of me last night and this morning
Please put this on your list
I am optimistic that they will agree to this language
Thought you might want to see it
Once they are loaded on the vessel the project specific cargo policy will go into effect
I have seen none so far
Depending on the data hopefully we can utilize the Enron Corp program in the interim
If not we will need to secure interim coverage and that could take some time
Also please send me any supporting data such as insurance language you have available
I need to know the following
What is their value each
Can somebody forward me same
How long will stored at their present location
Where are they headed after that
If coverage is needed here I will secure same or access the Corp Program
I need specifics
Could you let me know your time frame
The sooner we get that to them the better
See if I what I came up with works...if so we can use on all other Facility Agreements
Kay it would be good if you could join us...as we're in the home stretch
Oh my gosh that is so sweet
You caught me by surprise
You and I can discuss the agency agreement then get them on the line
Bet labor was easier with your daughter
Could you send me the full name of the buyer and we'll get the documents moving
I forgot about the happy hour
Where is it
Picking him up an hour later might be a lot easier and it doesn't bother him
Are you going to any of tomorrow's activities
I should be able to accomodate the schedule
Can you please review and get me comments ASAP
Andrew Bob and Coralyn pls advise if you would like to take a different approach
She can be very unclear in what she expects from you
This style may not bother you as you may in fact get comfort from working closely with someone
Clearly she has a lot of experience to impart and she is very very nice
Kay--got it on my list
I'm handling outside counsel and spoke with him this week
I haven't seen anything else
Should I just leave him after gymnastics
I don't really want to come back the office but I do want to go to Anne's
I'm going to give it another look then I suspect we will be ready to go
Is it foggy or raining
I can't see anything out my window
I guess I wasn't clear in my request however
Pursuant to your request attached please find the forms for the break-out agreement and exhibits
When that is determined we will provide the LF guarantee at the time the site conditions are known
To complete the agreement we need Ben Jacoby's fax number and a liquid fuel performance guarantee
I haven't tried yet
Things are ok Michael is mad because I won't let him open a present
I just got out of my meeting
Have you been able to reach Rey yet
Please suggest any additional complaints/shortfalls which we need to raise
I'm home with a sick kid and I don't have his telephone number with me
Do you have the draft with the memo of issues
I'm out today but we can discuss it tomorrow and I can explain my point of view
Please let me know if I can help with this
I'm a bit afraid to commit until he starts looking better
How is Thursday night for a family dinner as we discussed
Lastly no news from anyone today on my front
I'll call Michelle on Wednesday if I don't hear anything tomorrow
I spoke with Ben this afternoon
Please call me to discuss these items
Please let me know the answers to these questions
That will give me time to focus on this
I will call tomorrow
Please send to Kay Mann and copy me on responses
Planning on it
Hey they are making me crazy and I'm just reading your emails
Kay Kay I just received your voice mail message
I sent the attached memo to my client yesterday
I will be here all day today but out tomorrow until late afternoon
I wasn't sure you had this
Sheila please just email me your comments because I am not available this morning
I just wanted to send it out early
Hope you got situated in your new swanky spot
Can't wait to see what you've done with it
I'm attaching Paige's resume since she is interested in a summer internship
I will initial and handle signature
If we can get this done today that would be great
Also I understand from Ben that the deal with Coral is scheduled to close on Thursday
Jim-your e-mail to Carolyn Campbell was just forwarded to me
Since Carolyn will be out most of this week please direct any correspondence regarding this matter to me
We have received documents from them but no definitive word
The name is in the draft agreements I forwarded
Call/email me to confirm the time and location of this meeting
Call me if you wish to discuss this information
I took very poor notes from your phone call
Did you want to see a form of LOI
Looks like the call will be too late for him
Should I plan to attend the hearing
Please send it to me and Lee Johnson tomorrow if possible
Are we ready to go
Please call me after you have reviewed this
This is the same comment I made earlier
Exhibit R is blank however it is unclear whether this Exhibit is still relevant
Could you please get Dick to sign this
Can he sign for NEPCO also
Who does their legal work
I haven't had a chance to review the LLC Agreement yet
I think Friday is perfect
I will confirm which is the final version and send to you and John
Can we do it tomorrow
John Do you have any final comments
I just spoke with Delores
She will call in the Rx for us
She said they are working a short day Friday am
You won't get me to bet on this one
Guess we need to make the final decision
Until I next see each of you have great holiday and drive safely
I'll turn on my cell phone when I leave the office
I had the call anyway with Mike and Steve
Sorry I missed the call
Are we just going to go with the contact at Sweetgum or are we also going to add Ben
I know you were anxiously awaiting these documents
More fun for your file
How do you feel about their changes
Here are comments from Joe Halprin our in house lawyer
For your information/approval
It is included however in the execution copy being sent to you via Federal Express
Should you have any questions or comments please don't hesitate to contact me
Do you have an electronic version of this
If not can we get a copy from Lee
As you predicted
I spoke with Mary Perkins in Treasury
I MISS YOU
Hope you had a great holiday
Let me knwo if you have any questions
No one has said anything to me about closing next week
I understand that these are final
Aren't they the same
Which one are you printing/signing
Lisa advises that she will be in tomorrow as well
Lisa please correct me if any of this is not accurate
Sorry but I don't know
Dale are you available
Pete Thompson is on vacation next week but I suspect he would be glad to call in
As you know the HSR Act imposes a premerger notification obligation for mergers and acquisitions exceeding certain size thresholds
If we can get the signature page right we can get it over with
Thought it already was but I heard from Brett that it is not
Would you or Chris be able to call in
I spoke to Suzanne Adams earlier
Carlos has my proxy on the consent
Can either of you help me
Please forward your comments to the e-mail group listed above
Please email the document to me when it is done
Also you can leave me a voicemail if you want me to debrief someone on the project
I am giving him your name as his contact at ENA
I have already sent him the NEPCO signed pages
Lastly leave me a voicemail at work if you need to reach as I will check it on Wednesday
Can you email it to me
I wasn't sure you had the last version
I will email an exhibit which needs to be inserted
I will be sending those agreements momentarily
I don't have any language like that on hand
I suspect it will be in great demand
If so do you have some language I could use
Please forward all original documents to me
My assistant isn't here so I can't tell what I have yet
Please note that it remains subject to comment by Enron
I told Michael he could wake her up when he wanted to which I presume didn't take long
Last week really wasn't a very good week to take off and I was really stressed
It helps knowing that I have a holiday in two weeks
In the meantime please familiarize yourselves with the documents
Suzanne just gave me the documents
I like having the electronic versions as well
I can't believe it feels so good to be back
I must be crazy
I will deliver the original Guaranty Agreements to you today
I want to address it with GE today
I am unable to find your request
In future this element will be driven by the type of Property you are taking out
As you suggested on the phone it may be worthwhile to produce a form for this kind of notice.
Anyone please help if you can
What would we have on the LLC's
However that doesn't keep us from distributing $
What shall I do with them
When can we write checks and be done with all this
Do you know if the books are done or are the papers in a stack
I haven't checked yet
Please review and provide me with your comments/proposed changes
I will then forward you two signed originals for NRG's execution
I believe the override letter needed signing as well
Should I send the unsigned originals somewhere
George left me a message looking for an update
I expect to hear from them soon
Please review and advise of any comments at your convenience
For some reason my email wouldn't go through
I should have an answer to the invoice question tomorrow
Fred I forwarded you the notice prepared by Global Finance
Chris Please fill in Columns B C D & E with current information from our equipment contracts
I welcome your input on the information contained within this schedule
Call me to discuss any of this information
Give Lil a big ol hug for me
I miss her
Did you hear that Carlos is joining us
I haven't seen the fax yet
Maybe it got stuck in the wrong pile
Did you receive the signature pages I sent by fax
Ben/Fred/Rebecca could you please prepare a draft of the two exhibits
I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement
I don't know if you want to see these types of documents but what the heck here it is
I haven't seen it come back
Hope you had a good holiday
I thought I would share what I'm learning if nothing else as a form of therapy
I need LJM
So everyone on our end has signed
Are we ready to sign the Fountain Valley contract
Have you seen sig pages for ESA yet
I went to Sheila's meeting
Ozzie would be fine I guess
Did you go
I don't care one way or the other
Is there a reason why you want to skip it
I just thought that would be fun to do and my mom wants Michael to come so badly
In fact Michael and I can go alone some time
Like I said last night you would make a great guide
You do mind if we skip this party
I hope to have it to you by noon you time
We are not wiring money we are receiving money
Have you approved it yet
Please email me the execution version of the escrow agreement
Are we using one two or three
I prefer the weekend
It gives us a reason to get in and get out
No reason other than I don't really care to go
I really would like to do the FtW Show
Would weekends work best for you
I didn't check the price
The escrow agreements and fee schedule appear fine to me
If you have any comments please advise
Please forward your comments to me
It is amazing what I find if I check my email
This could become interesting if it holds up
When do you want to go
When are we going out for drinks
However I have not heard from him since circulating the draft amendment
I prefer to keep it kind of small if that's ok with you
I see you are free on your calendar but I didn't know if you already have tentative plans
Would you like to go
I don't want to be the one that blows it so I'm glad to keep you in the loop
Happy to list them individually however
I live off of lists
It happens to all of us
I still have a bizillion roses in my yard
I love them and I don't baby them
I figure if they die I replace them since they aren't that expensive
I only invited Dan and Sheila
Dan has rsvpd yes but I don't think Sheila has even had a chance to look at her emails
Want to keep it just us
Where would you like to go
I'm going to put it on our calendars
Would you like to invite Neil too
Oh I decided I'm going to start growing roses since mine have done so well
Those hibiscus are pretty but they only last one day
I need a sanity check
Maybe I should set it up in a separate letter
I lifted the language from the consent
They came by and gave me the data dump
Please advise of any comments at your convenience
If acceptable I will forward drafts to George
I will talk with him first thing in the morning
We will call you to confirm the correctness of these values
Did you see anything
Were you able to find my faxed signatures
Do you need originals
Looks like your stuff
Have you seen the signature pages
Thanks for taking my car in
Works for us
We haven't been able to locate it
Where should I send your set of docs
Are we ready to sign these today
How many originals do we need
Do you think this is a good Roger task
How are we coming along on the items below
Please call if you need additional information regarding the above
As far as I am concerned the Escrow Agreements and the Fee Schedule are ready for execution
I forwarded Roger the docs separately but thanks for the reminder
I am capable of forgetting
Finance will have comments to you this afternoon
The form is attached for your review
Just got your email re assignment out of TurboPark
For your information and contemplation
I haven't seen the executed agreement come back
Has it been signed yet
Please send the docs to me only and I will talk to Ben
Thanks for your help and patience in this process
I'll check to see if he is here tomorrow
I don't know what the hell he is up to
Lunch is always good but you could also just come for a visit any time he is in town
Kay-does this mean we don't get the work
Please provide me with copies of these documents and we'll make the changes
Let me know if we can be of any assistance
Please email directly copy to Ben Fred and me
I really appreciate all your good work and will pass that along to David Runnels and Paul Pipitone soon
I will forward those Exhibits to you shortly
I need to go to DC next Tuesday
I'll get with you tomorrow
I'm trying to get off the phone with you know who
I'd better meet you downstairs or wherever we are going
Please do what you can to expedite
We have resent to your fax number
Please send my set of documents to G G Garcia
Can I release a preliminary draft to Alan
Could you send me the current draft in whatever shape it's in for the Fountain Valley ABB contract
As you know I just love to pile on
I've contacted John Keffer and asked them to help
He is going to get the number for us as it is buried in a data sheet somewhere
Once the assignment and assumption agreement form is approved it will need to be signed by GE
I told Julie that Michael's calendar is open for this evening
Hope that is ok for you
Lisa has it as well
I put a couple of steaks in the fridge
Would you like to go out tonight
Sounds like we can at least meet somewhere after work
She didn't leave me a voice mail
Did Sheila leave you a voice mail
She was trying to call you this morning
I think she wants to talk to you about something
Let me know when I can talk to them about this
This document is being reviewed by the bank so I'm not convinced it is in final form
I cut and pasted from the consent to assignment from the TurboPark documents but shortened the whole thing considerably
Obviously we need your signature
Do you know what flights you'd like to take where you'll stay etc
How long will you be there just one day
I'll send it
In addition we should simultaneously exchange fully executed counterparts of the escrow agreements and the fee schedule letter
If you have any questions or comments
Ben I suggest we let Kathleen coordinate the assembly of the docs to be signed
Want me to get them ticketed
I just initial the signature
Also I need you to initial the docs where Enron is signing
Here's an outline of what I was thinking of using
Obviously there are huge holes in it but I wanted to see if I'm on the right track
I've asked him to call me to discuss
No - he wants to see the breakout but generally the commercial ts and cs are the same
Thanks for all your work on these
Do I need to do anything to your DC flight reservations
Ok I was scared there for a minute
Has this been a long afternoon for you
It seems awfully long to me
FYI I will be working on this over the weekend should you care to comment
I can't believe we have a puppy
Everything smells like puppy to me even though I took a very long shower
I brought one of our puppy books to the office and I'll sneak a peak when I can
I hope the resting on the chest didn't mess it up but boy was I desperate
He did great using the grass when we got up
He definitely knows why we go outside
Kaley picked on him a little but she was at her food bowl
I set up the little crate where she can't look in it so he has an escape
I'll put it on your desk
I don't remember seeing an agreement which isn't to say that I haven't
Can you forward me what we have on that
Do I get any bonus points for this
I can't recall if I've sent you this override letter before
I am not sure you have seen this agreement
However I am cautiously optimistic that we are not too far apart on the Hub Agreement
I haven't seen a revised flight schedule from TAP
Have they made the change yet
Per our chat
Do you want to print sign and fax or shall I take to Janet or someone else to sign
Have you received the delivery yet
I'll be in DC tomorrow although my schedule will be tight
Hey at least it is a local call
I would like for you to participate
In addition we would like the opportunity to meet with you before hand
How does that sound to you
Looks to me like notice will be given Wednesday or Thursday
The changes are being made to the CA I documents now
I had Ozzie sign it and it has been sent to Carolyn
Will he be there tonight or shall we go for tomorrow am
I hope to take this Friday as a vacation day
If so it looks ok to me
Here's a set of CA I revised docs
If these are ok we will get CA II lined up as well
Ben Fred are you ready for us to give notice
I'm attaching the notices for CA I and CA II
Please pay particular attention to CA II since it is the first time it has been circulated
Obviously we will need to insert the final purchase numbers
Lisa I set it up so ENA is consenting which tracks the language in the DCMA
I will let you know later what happens at the hearing
Sounds good but if today isn't a good day it is not a problem
I would like to have a chance to read it which I haven't
I still finishing up the Intergen docs
Other than that it looks good to me
Are you OK with us sending this out
If you have any questions or comments please advise
She says you worked together at Chase
When are you expecting the package to be delivered
Can't it be this pm
I haven't talked to anyone
Carlos called is he still going
It's your birthday lunch what do you want to do
Well you must be famous in the I bank bidness as she claims to know you
Didn't mean to leave you out
I love Vincent's and it is close so I say we go for it
So should I make reservations
This is a new transaction so you can put in your two cents worth early
I was unclear if you had seen these before
So I do not think that we have any major state issues
Should we keep that
This all ok with you
I should be in NYC Wednesday and Thursday
I don't need you to do anything in that regard yet
I'll hang it up
I think I have everything except the termination agreement
I'll check and send you what I have
Kay I have not received copies of any of the GE contracts
Do you have them
If so could I please have a copy of whatever has been executed
Kay Catherine and I have spoken with the bank about the Notice
I thoroughly enjoyed my ten years with Enron and it has been a privilege to lead EECC
Just thought I'd keep you current
Have you received any e-mail from me
When I asked the question I was told that the invoices needed to go to Jody
I haven't talked to Ozzie today
Are you guys still going out tonight
I would like to review the stuff before I leave town
Could I come over Tuesday and give it a look
So do we have someone to watch the menagerie
I could probably leave sooner but I wouldn't get anywhere any quicker
So can I buy you dinner and a drink
In response to your question on delivering the assignment documents to George I am somewhat indifferent
I thought Ben wanted to get this out
Where would you like to meet
I don't think there will be much to it
Here's the latest I have but there may be another turn in the works
I've asked Pete to send it to you along with the GE
I spoke with Lisa about that yesterday
Is there any other info you need on the ABB breakout
Dinner with family and Dad's widowed friend Claude and his daughter Lisa who we have known forever
Any plans for you
It is pretty close to what you saw last week
A faxed signature would work then we could have the originals picked up from Lee's office
Sorry Pete I thought I had sent it to you previously
I have reviewed the below document provided by Kay Mann
Once there they could not be used in Project Moore since that Project must be kept off balance sheet
I don't have any better idea than that
I haven't seen the originals
Do we intend to attach a form LLC agreement
I just sent my comments to you and Carolyn
Are you good to go
I like Bodie
I'd go with Bubba but that's what we call our cat
In my opinion this will be the biggest issue with ABB
So we need to make arrangements for that to happen
So who is the lucky person for your project
Sheila needs the fully executed agreements for TurboPark so let me know
If you need a VP Jake Thomas
Have you talked to Karl yet
Do you mind calling him
Unless you think we have a problem I'm ok with going along with George on this
Therefore I'm fine with your suggestion
I am okay with this
I ordered these for Christmas and am totally aghast that these orders are just now being processed
Thank you for your recent Pfaelzer Brothers order
This is an acknowledgement of your order
When sending us email please include your full name zip code and order number
Thanks for hanging in there and getting it done
I just always assume that you've taken care of it unless you tell me otherwise
I don't want to change my expectations
Just wanted you to know the docs went out Friday night
She wasn't upset about it though
Anyway just wanted to acknowledge my mistake
See you and have a good weekend
I think I will go by Hebert's on the way home
I think we will be staying in Richmond
Heather Kroll will be meeting with us
Do you need any help with hotel reservations
Ok I'm out of it
Where's she going
You deserve it
I've mentioned it to Pete Thompson but he is in our offices today so he can't do it
The banks need to see it redlined against the Master contract
Also who do I call to get the ABB override agreement
Would you check with ABB
Is it Mike Sandridge
This is where I will be this afternoon
Come prepared to discuss whatever questions or concerns you may have
Hope to see all of you there
I only see two in my packet and only two are referenced in the transmittal letter
I have not seen the termination agreement since I returned
Maybe someone else picked them up
I can't tell you what's going on with the assignment
But I have not seen the invoice yet
Did the invoice go to them
I have no pride of authorship
I suspect the whole trip will cancel but I don't want to give up the flights yet
It would probably be a good idea for me to stop by but it isn't mandatory
I got an opinion from outside counsel
I'll give it a look so we can discuss
I'll move it up on the list
Please let me know ASAP if you are unable to attend
I am not aware of any change order modifying those dates
Lee I'll forward you my comments separately
I don't know the resolution of that issue
So it looks like we need to supercede these documents along with the assignment and assumption agreement
I believe the entities I mentioned yesterday are still applicable
If you have a different opinion let me know
Mom was asking my about cake and I don't know what is on the menu for dessert
Guess we can ask for cake
Neil thought we should have cake at the PH
That may be too out of character for all of us but we can aspire to organization
I cringe at the thought of Six Flags
Hope your week is quiet
We had a great time and we are completely exhausted
It was fun to go but if I were you I would hire Paige to take Michael there
It was nice chatting with them
I think they were afraid that it wouldn't get better
But it seems like it is better now
I'm keeping my fingers crossed
Now let me see if I can remember the things Mama wanted me to tell you
Also do you know if we will be having birthday cake for desert
If not let me know and I can always bring one
That's pretty good for us
I think I'll wait and talk to them tomorrow
They take a lot of energy you know
Tell your family hello for me
I will resend it if you can't find it
I have a conflict
Was it deleted intentionally
I do not know why it was deleted
Rigby caught it
Should the originals go to you
I forgot I asked him to send it to you
I will get back to you by tomorrow with any comments
His preliminary assessment was that everything was ok but he wants to check
Wow Rebecca was reading my mind
Please call to discuss implications of his comments
Evidently we are experiencing some technical difficulty on this end
That was nice of her
I can't seem to get any traction on getting things done
Michael wanted to go to Jilian's tonight but I told him no
I love these stories
Hope you have a good day
I will let you know what I hear
Kay do you want me to send this to Carolyn
Hope all is going well with you
We miss you
Do you have anything you can email me
Attached is the CA we discussed
I'm glad we got to do a real deal even if it was a strange one
Hope things are going well for you and your shadow
I don't feel so good so I'm seriously considering going home
I do not know their function or role
I'll let you know if I think of anything else
I suspect Sheila will have some insight also
Thank you in advance for your suggestions
Because this is a tax-deductible contribution Enron will match your donation dollar for dollar
Did you check out the link to the spandex picture
I had to forward this to you
Please don't let this happen to me
Love ya don't think less of me
Actually I thought it would be good for leslie seeing as her wedding is during the holiday season
Hope you feel better soon
Could you let me know how many there are so I'll know how we want to handle this
Shall I check with Charlotte about dinner at Keffer's
Could you ask John if he likes it
Can it be installed anywhere in the house
Sent by Enron Announcements Thank you for your participation in our first two pilots
Can you confirm that a non-smoking room was requested
Can you take care of Michael
The dinner is in River Oaks so we could just drop him off
I think it makes him look taller
I wish it worked that way for me
It is very short and I think very cute
Is it in final form and if so has it been executed
It's on my book
Tomorrow do you want me to take him home or to my apartment
I promised him something fun
I just noticed it's a Friday
I think I'm going to be in NYC tomorrow otherwise I'd say your place
Neil and I are looking forward to it
Is this required by our agreement or just a nice touch
I'll send you the list separately
Yes but you would have to track down all those people
I don't know if you opened the attached document but George has done everything for us
All we need to do is get the letters signed
Please calendar for Sheila and me
Please make yourself available
A location will be sent to you soon
If you have any conflicts please let me know as soon as possible
Rose can you take responsibility for the basic OBS stuff
At least I hope so
Let me know if this doesn't get you what you need
I don't think it compared the charts but it found lots of other things to compare
Any suggestions of what we should do with the original LOCs
I've asked Kay where they should go
Please follow up with her on this
I don't know what's wrong with me
He took blood to check my organs etc
Thursday is the big day fight with Dr Hamilton over whether it's hormones do I need a hysterectomy
Let me rephrase that an aging woman
He's a cutie too so if you ever have an ulcer or hiatal hernia I highly recommend him
He's really a great doctor very thorough and you odn't have to take your clothes off all the time
I love that
I saw pictures on the tv screens on one of the floors but I didn't hear about the capture
How did they do it
Happened in Woodland Park CO this morning and they think they have a good lead on the others
They claim they have the leader also
We haven't responded to it yet
I suspect you will be consulted about it soon so I thought I would give you a heads up
Thomas I had some correspondence faxed to you today
I thought you addressed that well in your memo however I have another question
I assume not but I want a sanity check
I will forward you an additional copy by fax
I enjoy the ride with him
Should have included you guys as well
Does this mean they didn't have to induce
Please tell her congrats if you talk to her
Why don't I call you after I ask Michael
I don't know what he has in mind for entertainment
Also what is your cell phone number in case I can't reach you at work
I haven't been able to take anything but orientation yet but I hear great things about the classes
I will then forward them to Jeffrey Darst for his signature
Could you forward the attachment referenced in your email
I threw the initials in there for your benefit
Sorry - I could not resist
Has anyone asked you to take a look at this
If not I would be interested in your comments
If this version is acceptable we will execute originals and forward to you
Do you need more than one original for the optionor
I'll send you the final doc's so we can discuss
I generated the forms then finance and the banks commented on the forms
Please give me a ring when convenient
Attached hereto please find the draft Ledford-Titan Option to Purchase Real Estate and Grant of Easement for your review
Therefore please send me your comments at your earliest convenience
I think Sheila probably got this invitation
I need to get the LJM signatures
Have we sent it back to Siemens
Sent by Ben Jacoby@ECT I haven't seen this
ABB is asking for its original of the facility agreement
In fact I need to get originals of the ABB and GE facility agreements to ABB and GE
When can I get those docs
Please let me know ASAP so I can change the call information etc
In addition there is another matter regarding other correspondence we need to have in hand that other letters reference
Absence of this correspondence jeapordizes our claim
I would appreciate any input you may have
I can only open it if I launch it
I can't view it
I think I can print it
So are you Gold
If not go ahead and use the miles if you want
I haven't heard where we will be staying
As for the interconnection agreement it would be great to have a internal working draft this week
Also we could have some general preliminary discussions with VEPCO about it if we feel ready
What is your timing on the interconnection agreement
Can you wait until then
If not I'll retrieve them
Just got it so I haven't read it
I need to know who to charge it to
I will be in Chicago tomorrow
I will be in the Houston office by noon on Friday
Congrats on your new baby
As luck would have I have to leave town this week
I need to cancel this class
Well I hope this won't be too complicated
Did you hire Cory and if so what did you think
I wonder if SOTW has something
I will send over these documents today
I will miss getting the pat on the back
As you know things are subjec to change
I suspect most days he could go to your place
Have you heard of any other good day camps
Hey we all can use a little money
Honey I think we discussed C T Systems doing the filing
Do you recall how much it was
If not I can see what I can find out
What do you know about those items
Just let me know what you want to do
I would love for him to participate
Since it would be at Enron I can't see any problem
If you were out of town I could take him home or work it out with Neil
Anyway if Paige is accepted I would be happy to be backup
As I said I think this is moot but we would have it covered from all angles
Since we shouldn't have any obligations under an option agreement I don't worry about arbitration
Let me think about it though
I had the wrong week
I had Mexican food for lunch so popcorn for dinner
Are you going to the store
If you do I could use some Diet Coke silver and gold
Do you want to take your dad some
See you tonight sweetie
Is this the same lady you asked about this morning
The two Def Leppard tickets are hers
We are staying at the Richmond Marriott or Marriott Richmond whichever it is
Nothing extraordinary needed just your basic version
It should be under Diaz Ann if she got an invite
Surely she got invited
I left England for this
I wanted to make sure that you saw this
Assignment - although we reached an accord for TurboPark purposes the basic issues remain for discussion
Termination - This ones on my list
I don't think Carolyn needs them but I will think about it
I would love to see Nancy though
She did a very nice job for us
I can't find any information on Corey
Can you give me a little background information
Hope all is well with you and I hope we can get together soon
I discussed outside counsel with Jeff and I would like to use John Klauberg at LeBeouf
I've asked Clark Thompson for some information on his background
I know you don't always get the word so here's the word
How's your brother
Gotta hear about your trip
Was it fun
I HATE THE CARPET IN THE BEDROOM although it does hide dog hair well
If we want to stick with dark carpet I like the green upstairs
Well there's no instant gratification with that although it is logical
You are welcome to join us
Let me know if you would like to see it
Did I write you back
I like the work a lot and I have some nice clients
I can't wait for Carlos to get here though
I went to Izzo's going away reception last week
I hope you keep baby pictures with you at all times
I hear you are again working with Carlos
Congratulate him for me
Are you free for lunch on Thursday or Friday next week
I still have to show you some baby pictures of Reagan
Please call me with any additional questions
You're right it sounds better spoken than it looks written
I get the point though
I will have one in the am to send out
Do you want Jude et al to look at the EPC contract stuff
We will have some comments on the asset management attachment but I don't have those together yet
In looking through our files I don't find a confidentiality agreement
Have you asked Rusty
I believe Kathleen gave him a hard copy yesterday
I made the changes myself
Here's the option we discussed yesterday
Also I am trying to get back on the Intercompany loan stuff
If so maybe we could get together for half hour or so to go over the loan stuff
If so I will probably ask you to have Janet execute it at your convenience
There is good news as many of you know
In this regard I would truly appreciate any contribution that each of you might be able to make
I ran a redline from the last version I had electronically
Do you have a cost plus form that you like
It was good to see you yesterday by the way
View it don't launch it then you can print it
I can't open the attachment can you
I paged you soon after I left the school but never heard back
I also tried your cell but it said it wasn't on
Are you plugged in today
I'd like to give them a day or two first
Kay can you advise when you expect execution
Do you know when this payment will need to be made
I feel into marathon meeting mode today
Here are my observations of the GE contract
I don't know the deal so I don't know how it fits
Again I don't know the deal so this may be fine as is
I haven't seen the proposal or any other technical exhibits but sometimes these can be very self-serving
Therefore you can potentially lose ground with what is in the exhibit
GE ususally gives us indemnity for any hazardous substance they introduce
I finally have reviewed them and have a couple comments
Accordingly the proposed changes are my attempt to clarify the usual text
From your perspective is this document ready to be sent out
I made it to NYC with no problem
I'm on my way to a meeting
Do you see any problem with this
I will have to have the electronic form emailed to me then I can make the changes
I brought the hard copy but I don't have access to the electronic form
Have they indicated if they want to go forward with this or are they still kicking tires
In that won't work I will have more details about timing of my Friday meeting tomorrow
OK Friday was going to be really difficult for me anyway
I think it's premature to have legal on the line
If they want to have a commercial discussion we can proceed without legal
I spoke to NRG this morning
Are you available to call in from New York
If not can Carolyn Campbell sit in for you on the call
Let me know sometime today
Could you email it to me
I am OK proceeding without legal on the line
I'm out of town but will give this a look when I return
I know T Mueller is on holiday
Good luck and keep me posted
Did I send this to you yet
I'm flying home tomorrow but I won't be in the office
I've picked up several new deals this week a couple of them would be perfect for Carlos
When are you coming home
Could you forward this to Jon
I don't have his email address
The scheduling problem is due to my travel plans
Otherwise I'll catch up with you later about the results of the call
Do you have some free time today
Mark and I are still working at the hotel waiting to hear from the counterparty
As always I'm on a short time frame so your response would be appreciated
But we raise chickens for the meat market
I presume you got my mark ups on the term sheet
Neil hasn't mentioned Mac calling but I really didn't think we would hear from him again before today
We meant to leave the stereo - hope you don't mind
Paige got a new one for Christmas and her old one seemed perfect for the Pink House
We enjoyed our visit also
I hope Lisa has a nice birthday tomorrow even with sick kids
We sure found alot of goodies when we got here
Did you intend to leave it here
Have you heard from Mac lately
This will give you some free time a home
Yes but let me review it before anyone else sees it
Kay do you want me to do a draft of this
Do I need to get involved
How's about we talk about it
I think that's more efficient
As long as we talk before the next call we should be in good shape
This came in while I was on the road
Mac mentioned his girlfriend but he didn't mention the Rice thing
He and his friend were wonderful house guests
I hope no one got worse on your b day
How are you guys doing
As luck would have it Annie Katie and Bobby are all various degrees of sick
I hear that Mac is coming down
I hope that he likes what he sees at UH
You know his girlfriend has been offered a scholarship to Rice I think
It is brand-spanking new so I don't know much more than this
There's a rumor that we are buying some new turbines from GE but I haven't been contacted
The rumor came from GE reps who asked if I was working on it
Sheila isn't handling either last I knew
Don't screw it up
Carlos you missed a wonderful evening on Friday
John it is hard to believe that you could have acutually have married UP
I don't expect a problem and am ready for it if it surfaces
Let me know if this is not the one you wanted
I will determine their interest in transacting on the Titan project
Let me know how you see it happening
On the NRG call I am waiting to hear back from NRG
If the other folks sign before it has been reviewed internally it is possible that changes will be required
I don't get why we're changing this document at this time
Brian requested I send you a copy of this document
Give me a call if I can be of any assistance
Attached is a red-line of the revised form against the form John S sent me
In the interest of time I'm sending it out before I've reviewed it so forgive the typos etc
Please email the letter to me before Ben signs it
In order to do this GE requested that we send them the original LOCs
I need the appropriate address contact name and phone number for CA Development I and II
I left the letter mentioned above on your desk on Friday
Have you had a chance to look at it
If not I can send it to you electronically
Bart is it you
Kay are you the legal contact on Florida
Have they issued the news one yet
Here's the contract we discussed on the telephone
It is a heck of a cut-and-paste job but it will really help when we start blacklining docs
Kay thanks for sending this to me
Unfortunately I am having difficulty opening the document
Was it written in something besides Word?
I got someone else to help me
I've made some suggested changes on the CO you sent
I should have included you
I had Mexican food for lunch so LITE dinner for me
I had lunch with Oz and Heather
Oz drove us in his new MB convertible
I vote for them to do whatever needs to be done
I seem to remember some of this being done
Price is the same whether it is a corp or partnership
When I travel for more than one day I usually take my computer and use it on the road
Hope you are enjoying this perfect weather
Looks like you may have snow in New York
Is it O K for me to email you there
I hear Erik Kingshill is moving on
Please get someone to hang my white board behind my door
Can we make it more seller friendly without being ridiculous
What is your schedule
If you can print a copy I would appreciate it
I'm tied up but you don't need me anyway
I have not responded yet mostly because I don't know the answer
Kay Have you responded to this email or would you like me to do so
I expect you will hear from them shortly
They put it in the middle of the wall
Please have them come back and put it behind my door
I have put in the request and someone should hang your white board today
I specifically told them to put it behind your door
I would think it could be ready in a week
I'll get A & K to dust it off
Are we prohibited from doing this
If the attached document still gives someone heartburn I'll end it here and politely decline with Austin Energy
Did I ever send this to you
Let me know what they decide
For your reading pleasure
Could you get me the name address and telephone number of the hotel where I'll be staying in Richmond
When do you need the revised City of Austin Agreement
I'm concerned about bringing Michael downtown because of my travel schedule
Can you print this please
I can't seem to get it to print here
It sounds great and wow it couldn't be closer to the office
More importantly I bet Michael would love it
Would you and Michael like to join me
Lee asked that I pass this along
Please let me know if you want some tickets
I will have a minute in about an hour
Yes I'd be glad to talk to him
Until Carlos gets settled in send the guys to me
Trust me it won't take long to get him settled in
Kathleen do we have a land holding company for that region
I'll think about it from a TurboPark standpoint also
John said no attorney was helping with this yet so I suggested you and Carlos okay
I thought you were going to New York
It is just too far out of your way
I'll try to see if I can catch a ride somewhere
So I guess you would like a ride to work on Thursday
I'm sure we can do that
It might work better if you call
Innovative is a euphemism for something but I can't figure out the right word
Sent by Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling We've done it again everyone
Congratulations to all of you for making it happen
This was my first written request for a cost plus contract
I worked over the weekend to adapt the form to this project and forwarded it to EECC on Monday
I received no response to the revised draft
I NEVER talk to him anymore
I haven't talked to him in TWO weeks
I usually don't go more than a day or two at the most
The first sentence in the first bullet point concerns me
I forgot I had the letter electronically or I would have included it with the Change Order
Do you need the electronic file
All I sent was the redline
No it is not true that we are scrapping the document you worked on
I anticipate issuing a revised draft to you for review tomorrow
Per your voice mail
Just a reminder about our telephone call tomorrow morning
Have just received both of your e-mails
If we see forward progress tomorrow we will be all smiles
Again thanks for your reply
In the meantime if we may be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to call
Please let me talk to Ben
This is Ben's invitation to you and Roger
I think we should invite Roger and Kay
Is Stuart still involved in our area
Ben do you think you would want Kay Stuart and/or Roger to attend any of the meeting on Friday
All this confusion wasn't my fault
I guess we would need a CA for the broker then CA's with potential buyers
I don't think we need the language especially since the guarantees won't apply to retrofitting the plant later
I'm sure either or both of you are welcome although it won't be a problem if you don't attend
That would give me something to report
I know it is not St Thomas but it is a command performance
I just guessed on the attachment
Or do you envision a different next step
I hear Ben wants a ticket for Thursday but I assume he communicated that to Lee
Thank him for me but I have my closing dinner tomorrow and no sitter Friday
Do you mean LITERALLY across the street
That's making it tough to ignore
Steak doesn't really appeal to me
Lee just called and he is here so if you haven't called him yet please don't
Did you get a confirmation back
I made a mistake - forgot to send it to Lee
I didn't write it down and it completely slipped my mind
I really am terribly sorry
I left him a voice mail
Therefore I am hoping to force his hand and see his reaction to the CA
I didn't get the revised draft
Is this draft acceptable to you
The following are our comments to the subject change order
If you like we can set up a time to discuss these comments
Otherwise the paragraph first takes a responsibility away from GE and then re-imposes it
I don't think I would have Rob participate in the call
Is that what you mean
I thought it was a lot to ask
Please contact me or Fred Mitro with your comments
I'm forwarding a draft EPC contract for your review
If you can't reach me by phone send me an explanatory email
Also please email me redlines against prior drafts
This will faciliate my review
Faxing drafts does not work for me
I will send you the required changes tomorrow
I want more weather like last weekend
I was in NYC last week
I managed to get lost walking around Midtown
I know that's impossible
I was talking on my cell and walking
When I realized I was walking downhill with only warehouses ahead it clicked that I was off track
Are you going to spring training this year
I hope you made it
I was a real winner
Let me know how you are
Scooped me on Ray
I like him
Think he is going to Duke
Here is a draft for your review and if you think appropriate distribution to NJR
Please let me know if you want changes made
I just sent him another email with the document attached
If I don't hear from him I will definitely give him a call
I think it's readable because I can see it
I like San Antonio for the trip though
How did it go this morning
Isn't that where it was last year
John wants to talk to me
I haven't talked to John today
Carlos tell you about the security guard by HR
I registered twice
We could ask your mother to sit for a little while
I thought that was nice
Could you check out the sitter thing
The change I suggested would belong in both versions
Pardon the delay but I inadvertently left you off the email
Maybe we should drop him off
Sweetie how do you want to set it up
Should I pick him up at school or what
I do not exactly know where ENA's original went
Take a look at my comments in Redline
Just opened my email
I have a meeting tomorrow off campus
However emailing documents directly to me and calling me on the phone will be a big help
Those revisions arose following our teleconference with the Schaffers' attorneys
Although Don had subsequent conversations with Rusty and Stuart we should have circled back with you
Can you email me the blacklines just in case
Roger says he isn't working on it
How many times do I have to say EMAIL IT
Do you remember anything about this agreement
Are you ok to leave to pick up Michael
If not let me know and I can do it no problem
I have your rodeo tickets
My only advice is to be very specific in their scope
Look at it this way we've got MOST of the information
I've forwarded your email to Eric and have asked for his response
The changes were his
Michael and I had a good morning
Figures since I now have a camera ready to go
So what do you think about the stone thing
I like the way Bob's front yard looks
I'm not sore today but then again I didn't do all that much
Hope you are having a good day
I would appreciate your advise
Other wise I do not think that I have any problems
This is one of my top priorities
I think it looks fine
Hopefully you will get some credit for it also
I just love Lisa
I think she's a ton of fun
I will just put you out all day as jury duty
I haven't been called in a few years I'm sure my time is coming
Lisa Mellencamp will be doing the law conference in October and I will be helping
You know we will have a good time
Looks like it is ok to keep the same
When do you think we will have a draft
Thought it might be helpful
However I was not aware of the agreement that Bruce and Lee had
If Lee really wants to keep the original guarantee I can live it
Did you get a copy
Carlos and I will discuss how to move forward
I talked with PSEG this morning
Call me to discuss the timing of drafting such an LOI
Please see my earlier response
I sent him an email earlier and he left me a voice mail back
I'll call him and see what I can find out
Would it help if I call him
As for work priorities I would put it in front of the City of Austin agreement
I have jury duty on Wednesday
I really was liking the idea of a Durango
I do think Lisa and Bobby have been pleased with theirs but maybe they've just been lucky
Mitsubishi isn't attractive to me but I don't know why
Both said they have rescued their spouse more than once
Maybe we should look at something else
Maybe we should have the GE call on Thursday or maybe Friday am
At least it is only twice a year or in her case this one last time
He really loves it and my dad is in declining health but can still get around
That's what I was thinking too
Let me check calendars and send out an email regarding same
I ate at the Met so I had a big lunch
I would get the stone delivered as early as possible so that I can pace myself
Guess I should go look
How much do you think we need
But at least he can still walk
Michael adores his PopPop and March is a nice time of year on the cost
If I'm there I can do a lot of the hard stuff for my dad which helps
What kind of vehicle to you have
If she's not finished I'm going to get the doctor to look at her
I had to go buy her another box of maxi pads
Oh I agree you should let him spend time with your dad
What's wrong with your dad
Is it his heart
I know Emma really misses my mother
With the new Highlander Toyota will easily cement itself as one of the best-selling brands in North America
How can we be so sure
I really liked Don
Some of this space in our humble opinion should have been used to alleviate the still-cramped rear accommodations
Did I miss anything
You bring your lunch Limited Seating We provide drinks and dessert
I had a nice trip in
I tried a slightly different route and it was uneventful
How much does it cost to mail a letter now
I have no clue how much rock that would be
I think I will start with the Advil today
I walked the paper work to the school office
Hope your trip in was not too bad
I like the little videoscreen - how's that for a toy
I like the sound of the Highlander
Friday is good for me
Here's what you missed
Specifically I deleted language he had added to the waiver of consequential damages
I felt this was too broad of a carve out especially from the contractor's point of view
He has given up his apartment and has moved in
I really like both of them so I think this is nifty
I want to go to this on Thursday
I rsvp'd myself
I cannot locate the document here
I don't anticipate a problem but we should discuss it soon
Once that is signed we can go ahead and submit Jeffrey Keenan's cost estimates
Once these documents are finalized Allyson and I can continue to move your project forward
In the meantime as you know Allyson has been drafting resolutions for adoption by local government officials
What's your preference today
I can either meet you at our house or pick up Michael at your place
We'll track down Janet if that is ok with you
The enovate appointment looks fine but I made minor changes to the signature block if that is okay
At least now I don't also have lunch with John
As far as I know it is fine
It's on your calendar
Do you want to include Mike Sandridge also
I'm happy to volunteer my assistant Suzanne to help with the logistics restaurant suggestions keeping track of rsvp's
Any thoughts on whether we should invite the Coral folks
Please let me know your availability and of any restaurant recommendations
He and I have the day off together so I'm making some special rodeo plans
His winter report from his teachers was good
We visited in the am and I haven't seen him in the afternoon without meds
I'm forwarding a revised development agreement term sheet showing revisions from your original version
Assuming there's no bad blood I don't suppose it would hurt
I just don't know enough about the situation
I have jury duty today by the way
I don't know what these folks are up to
I have jury duty in just a little while so I'll be out of touch for a short while
I don't know if I'm going to be out of town
Mike Ron Chris Kay please advise of your availability as well
I received call from Mart T of SW
Anything for the grocery list my sweetie pie
I thought you might enjoy this
He was speechless and you know how rare that is
Just writing this is making me laugh
He'll love spending the time with you
I always enjoy Ozzie and Heather
Carlos joined us too
However if you need something please let me know
Thanks for the quick response my ass
I forwarded this to him prior to his e-mail request
Now I feel better
I will call you later this afternoon to discuss
Attached is our list of questions and requests
I'll send hardcopies when I get back in the office
Just wanted you to have a heads up
Sounds like a good approach to me
I'm so proud of myself
And so am I
Did you add your changes to it yet
I'll read the ABB contract on the plane and let you know what I think this afternoon
Hopefully we can put it to bed
Well it looks fair except the place of arbitration
I changed it on the confidentiality agreement but missed it here
Carlos caught it
One of us can
If they were unilateral then this form looks fine
Carlos tells me that he has had difficulty forwarding emails so I'm sending this along
As we discussed here is the letter and comments
I haven't been able to find you number
I'll try to track her down tomorrow
Did you have a chance to speak with John Nassos
If Janet signed it can I get a copy to give to Peoples
As you know Enron and Peoples jointly own enovate
Gregg do you want to correct any of what I wrote
Please call me when you have a chance
I've made some changes which I thought I would circulate internally for comment before sending to GE
Has anyone taken you up on the offer
I'm looking at it now
If you have any questions or comments do not hesitate to contact me
In the following chart please indicate your available dates and e-mail back to me as soon as possible
I worked out for the first time in a bizillion years
I think I saw our neighbor Kim playing basketball
I could really mess myself up after such a long hiatus
So when are you leaving today
Talk to you when you get back
I'll call you to reschedule
These comments are from our Finance group
Can't it be deleted
Here's the agreement I referenced in my voice mail
I was off work yesterday so I just got your email
Evidently there is some unclogging procedure they can do
Sounds dangerous to me but I don't really know anything about it
Just really bad allergies that make her wheeze
I'm not sure of the difference but I believe this dr
We asked this spring and he said not yet
I don't know why he doesn't want to play but I don't want to push him either
Maybe I should take him to watch some little kids play
Maybe we can come watch Annie play
I don't see why we would need to DASH exclusivity
Here's the latest word I have on the meeting which sets it for tomorrow
Is there something later which sets it for today
Please attend or call in if you can
If you cannot John will be glad to follow-up with you individually
I heard a rumor that it had been changed again but I don't know if it is correct
I appreciate the help in trying to keep track of it
Boy it's been non stop since I walked in
I doubt AIG thinks of itself as being in the middle
Can we remove AIG from the middle if necessary
Could you send me three brochures
FYI we are establishing another structure similar to Velocity to accommodate the transfer of non-merchant investments into Condor
I wish I knew how to do this sort of stuff
Speaking of tennis Michael asked Neil if he can teach him how to play
Neil said no since he doesn't know how
Remember how we used to hit tennis balls against the house
Can you believe we never broke a window
I can't imagine how loud that would be
I remember trying to encourage Paige to swim bike whatever
I think that's what she wants to tell you
When she was Michael's age we signed her up for t-ball
So we pulled her off and waited before we started her
Now she loves playing the game
If you have a conflict don't worry about it
Attached below is my humble contribution to this week's effort
I haven't worked with any workout folks
She isn't in that area any more but she used to be
I discussed this with Mark and he is fine with postponing the meeting
I should touch base with Lisa.
Ok with you
I'm sure he will have him at the CC
I now have a pager
I am working on a CRRA deal re fuel cells
Do you know of any continuing interest in that project
We may want to amend that one or terminate it if that project is dead to avoid any confusion
Individual.com also brings you FREE news on your investments
The Mountaineer's strengths lie in its feature content powerful engine choices and improved rear suspension
Maybe we should check out the Y on Voss to see what they have if anything
I know I will be hearing from Gregg about this soon
Here's the CA you requested
Attached is the CA for your review
This is the document that I referenced in my voice mail
I will call later to see if you've had any luck
As you can guess this is on a short fuse
Could you conform the NW one to the form
Sorry I lost track of the versions
Sorry I haven't sent the notice
When are you here next week
Are you around
Guess you can say this is a sanity check
If it looks good to you then I will send it out unless you prefer to make distribution
By the way I really appreciate your updates
I'm eligible to give blood again so let me know when Michael needs more donations
I'm sending this to Suzanne so she can make these changes
I'm attaching for your review a revised LOI
My memory has failed me once again
I will leave tomorrow afternoon returning on Friday afternoon
Thank you for your attention to this very important policy
Could you work on it
I'll bring it around
Sorry about the late deliveries but maybe you will be able to pick these up in the am
Here's the PSA I mentioned
Thank you for looking this over
Take and look and see what you think
Dinners are on their own - no reservations have been made.
I think the pager is just too cool
Boy you are going to have it tough aren't you
I will send you pages with information should I need you
I just love that pager
Whenever he gets around to it I guess
I don't want to get in the middle
What are you projecting for a closing date
We have the forms so we can get cracking without outside counsel
I can get started on the process if you are ready
Kathleen please talk to me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers
I understand that you are in Houston
Can Carolyn complete this while you are in New York
I'll get Kathleen to do it as she has my current favorite form
I will get Ed to prepare the CA if you wish
Also in a separate email could you send me the C of A
I want to make sure I have the latest greatest of each
Gee if you hurry you can still make it to the volleyball game
Do you have the names/addresses of the interested counterparties
I will talk to Lee Johnson this morning
I'll call you after I talk to Lee
I want to make sure I bring the right clothes
Here's a new deal for you
I think I probably want to drive each one more time
It was Mike Kent and me
By the way the contact sheet that Steve distributed was the one we prepared
I'll catch you up on other stuff when you have time
No big deal if you can't
Well I just don't know what to tell you
Am I confused
I passing the ball to Carlos who will get with you and Kathleen to figure out what's what
That sounds great to me
I love a good punt
When our team is kicking well it's a bonus
I'll send the paperwork to Kathleen when it becomes available
I set it as my new wallpaper
I set it as my wallpaper also
I haven't gone to Mark with it yet though
We have forms etc for this and I'm happy to provide whatever support I can
Please advise as to how you would like to proceed
I just got off the phone with Lee Johnson at GE
Fred-could you please contact everyone and set this up
As soon as I get the revised proposal from Lee I will forward it to the group
I talked with Panda this morning
I believe that this is doable
Chris Booth will provide you with respective unit delivery dates
Kathleen I have a call into Bill Lamb at Panda regarding the CA's
I will let you know when I hear back from him
I don't have any messages from Nancy yet but I'm sure we will get a few today
What feedback have you received on the Portland legal question
I will bring him up to speed
I'm in Florida and looking out my window I saw an alligator swim by
I forgot to tell you this
When we were at Blockbuster last time Michael was trying to talk me into buying two videos
Since you are coming from the Astro Arena won't it be just as convenient for you
I haven't heard back from Dale
Sheila and I have swapped voice mails
I sent SW a letter confirming that agreement
Lynn tells me that they should sign it soon
I would expect it this week
I ran into some complications
So I could be home as early as Friday
Just thought I'd fill you in
I did write it for them and sent it to Lynn
I would suggest getting Allegheny to buy off on it
Here is the form of LLC agreement we used for the Intergen deal tweaked a bit for lessons learned
I will also forward the Intergen docs so you can see some of the definitions etc
I also have the TurboPark docs which I can forward when it gets closer
See my previous email
We had to amend the agreements to give us more time
The new version I sent you fixed that
Please advise of any further comments at your earliest convenience
I received your voice mail regarding the ABB contract
Power background would be nice but I know that may be too much to ask
I think getting the letter is probably belts and suspenders but I requested it anyway
Thank you for your helpful comments
On the timing issue we still have the time sensitivity but I hate to give it a precise day
I agree with deleting CO definition
Please call if you want to discuss these comments
I've read the opinion and agree with your summary of it
PS Of course I came in to the office
What are the odds that we file
Kay I made your flight reservation for Monday
We liked it however we want to price it with a couple of extra features
I like the extra wood package and Neil likes it with the gold trim package
So we can get the deal done if they will get reasonable over these options
The fellow you had told us to ask for wasn't in by the way
I will be out of town on Monday but Neil will be in and will have my Lexus
Rosco was in for his shots today
His paws look too big and his head is too small
Please find his contact information for me
I look forward to speaking with you soon
How does that work for you
This is the one I get to go to right
Please review and let me know if you have any questions
Have you checked this out
There's great news for you over at ClassMates.com
You've asked us to keep track of your fellow Southwest classmates
Are you one of them
Why not show off your improvements with a paid membership
All of us at ClassMates.com Delivering thousands of memories a day
I have a staff meeting and will be unable to join
I do plan to be on Friday's call
I find the process a challenge to manage
I had to cancel due to my travel schedule
I have a staff meeting every first and third Wednesday which I've told Sheila about
Are you here this am
You have a seminar on your calendar
Kay I've done the request and signed your name and faxed it out
Walker L Watters is his complete name
I spent yesterday in Clarksdale Mississippi
Don't make a point of spending your vacation there
I enjoyed our time together and look forward to more adventures
Roger was previously looking into this and proposed our standard form agreement
I need to get the LV contract fully signed up now
I'm sorry I missed seeing you last week
Personally I'd skip it and push to sign next week
I have a call in to Dale
Someone needs to name it
I don't have the attachment in front of me so I will have to look it up
I thought the language was awkward and tried to make it more clear but obviously failed
It SHOULD be the same as in the CA breakout contract with GE but I won't make that assumption
I'll open the doc and take a look at it asap
Commercially the inclination is to avoid that fee we need to confirm that approach
Staff has indicated that it intends to conduct further discovery i.e
As I understand it the case is being discussed internally at Peoples
Could I get a copy
Well what can I say
It represents job security for all of us
I need help on the general contracting under Miss law stuff especially since there are some quirks involved
This came back to me as undeliverable so I'll try again
Bottom line it's your call
If you choose to walk away I'm ok with it
If you do what do you want to do going forward
I guess someone thought of this again
This is when I'm out of town which is fine by me
I just received this from Panda regarding their project company structure
Steve I was correct in my assumptions
Please come see Carlos and I about the transaction
It would be great to meet you in person and have you participate
I have a couple of questions
Both time frames are mentioned in your explanation
We can discuss these comments if you want or just incorporate them
I believe the commercial operations terminology is appropriate not takeover
Hey you would probably like that
And don't just tell me in Mississippi
Please send to me at your convenience
Please let me know what time the meeting will begin
I would like to fly down early that morning if possible
Are you up-to-speed on this one
I can't recall who knows what
Sheila what do you think
Is that sufficient time to get to your offices or should I plan on flying in on Thursday night
I would bracket [Spawn] since we don't have it formed yet and we probably haven't checked on availability
Should we also have the right to specific performance
I haven't done a reg evaluation so I would delete the reg rep unless you are comfortable
I want the HSR risk to be with them so I don't want to contradict it with the rep
I hadn't heard back from them
Steve just left me a message confirming that
Did you ever see one come in
I think your suggestion will work
I'm so happy that you guys are coming to visit us
Do you know if your group wants signature or premier rooms
We will be in Bay City on Saturday but I don't know if it will be overnight
Just curious so I can try to figure out what I'll do...It probably won't be much but oh well
Ben and I can make it
Please advise if that time works with your schedule
I'll be available and will let you know how it goes
I don't believe I forwarded this to you
If it is a lease we have similar spending and EPC concerns as our other deals
Do we know who the O&M contractor will be
This was new news to us
Matt and Herman this is the transaction we discussed with Heather a few weeks ago
If so it would be very helpful if you could ship me the originals
I've got in on your calendar
Do your glasses give you a headache
I don't know who started the initialling kick and I don't know if I care if it continues
I don't know if Lee cares
If GE doesn't care then I don't care
I think I've lost my mind
Also please give them only one business day to review the final facility agreement
Also we need the duplicate forms for Sunlaw Energy Corporation
Will we be getting the drafts tonight
I'm just trying to tie up loose ends when I can
I suspect they must have gotten paid or else someone would be complaining
I made a couple of minor revisions
Jake has given us until when he gets in tomorrow
Perhaps it it redundant
Maybe we can discuss in the am
I hope he feels ok tomorrow
I'm sure he enjoyed the fine cuisine
I feel the same about going up next week
I suspect she'll come Friday or Saturday but don't know for sure
I like this one
I know you wouldn't forget but Ms Bills will need to be advised
I didn't ask for the conference call but I wil make time in my schedule to participate
Kay please let me know if you still need this conference call
Page me with info
It is the last two weeks of school I believe
I think I'll join the credit union
You may want to run it by Heather to make sure
I checked but I need to be double checked
Sorry I should have included you in the initial distribution
In the event that the deal blows up we will probably execute the change anyway
We can then see how many short we are and deal with the deposit
Let me know what you think I work with you however I can
Is it ready for me to print and give to Ben
Kathy how many originals do you think we should have signed
I'm not sure why this came to me but I thought I would share it anyway
Please be advised of our timeline
If you desire this optional equipment please reflect that cost in your final bid
Will you be making a pledge
You should have heard Ben complementing you to Jeff
The point was not lost on me
Neither have us have spoken to GE
I think Sheila spoke to Lee but I don't know the substance of the conversation
We asked his permission on the Intergen deal I believe
He said he wanted to talk to you about it
I'll be Tanto you can be him that sabes
Well that's one reason why I don't think there's a lot of risk to it
I think a casual conversation will work
Lastly is delivery but again I don't think it will be a big issue
Maybe if Jake knows that he probably won't have to tell Lee who the suitors are that might help
I will ask directly that he make it so
I spoke to John N and I think I understand what's up
Aren't you something
From now on you are Mr PSA
Also please note that our accounting group has also blessed this agreement
I also inserted your name for invoices
He did go out of his way to sing your praises so job well done
Thought I would pass it along
I will see you Friday morning
Sheila suggested this firm and Stuart said he thought they were an ok group
As you can guess it is a short list in Mississippi to chose from
I will send one of the exhibits separately
You can run but you can't hide
Here's more for you to enjoy
I would like to have Herman walk through it again
Maybe we should ask Herman to describe one
Have I missed the question again
Remember her saying she wasing going to stay out of it
Just shoot me if I do that to you
Or at least kick me
See..you're never far from our thoughts
And a tough crowd it is
I'm up for it
He seems genuinely happy for you
Two questions came to mind as I was preparing the draft
I think it is the fourth one below
I feel so guilty
Light dinner for me
If I can get time to call Nathaniel I will
I feel guilty about being gone Sat
I can check with her to see her preference
I need staples and the stiff green folders
I forget what these are called
I look forward to reviewing this list
We would appreciate your help in making this happen
He may have absolutely nothing to add but I wouldn't take the chance
Let me know if you think otherwise
Do not take this too seriously until we talk tomorrow
Hope it isn't too inconvenient for you to come
Sheila really wanted you there
I'm expecting a call from David Hunt so I haven't dealt with the limit of liability stuff yet
Also please let me know if you would like for me to have a redline version prepared
Obviously we want the economy of doing this once for both transactions
In the meantime I had a couple of questions
Second will you send me the blank certificates that will serve as the Membership Certificates for the LLC
Additionally we are drafting against ourselves
What have you got
Guess I didn't explain it all that well
I asked her just to call you directly and gave her your number
I enjoy the laughter
I was just jealous
Steve Attached is the Legal Services Agreement for your endorsement
Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions
This is on the horizon so I thought I would let you know
I'm with you - go Delta
I am selling my Bayou II kayak by Dagger
What do I need to do to join
I may not be going
I'll let you know tomorrow
Let me know as soon as you do
Can you direct me to the right place
Please see the message I received
Obviously I have access to email
Is there something I can answer for you by email
I understand that we received it from GE and that it is available only in pdf format
Did LegalNetEx send your ID and Password
PSA's are a hot topic and I have a call into Lisa Bills to discuss it
He was going to talk to Bart about his experience which could also add some extra insight
Renee please copy Ann on each draft you turn out including before you launch to the other side
I let you a voice mail message about this on Friday
Thanks in advance for your help with this task
I don't know the agenda for the meeting
I still need a Connecticut lawyer to look at this
Do you have someone available
I unfortunately cannot attend as I will be out of town
As you know there is no going back once we give up that optionality
Well there's your summo wrestler a fan wasabi peas and I think a sea shell
I TOLD HIM NOT TO WORRY ABOUT IT
I am a bad shopper but I will try
SO I GUESS YOU ARE OFF THE HOOK
As your gift me be a bit difficult to send back now think about something else and tell me
I want to make sure I'm looking at the right stuff
Do you have a form of bio for anybody around here
I need to make something up for the paper
I'll see what I can come up with for a bio
Well you know Enron
I hope that all is well
It sure sounds like you all are just buried
Well I'm glad I get to edit
Mark approved it this am
Hopefully good publicity which will make Mark glad he approved it
I hope you get it ok'ed
Plus there is the possibility that I might need to go to FW for my dad
I've thought about taking him to Moody Gardens or do some other fun stuff as an alternative
I don't mind taking him by myself
I can do most of the fishing stuff although I don't know squat about artificials
If I do go I would like to take Rosco
Since my folks have an internet connection I can keep up with a little work and write you too
Wanted to make sure you had seen/approved these
Please call with any questions you may have
Thought you might find this interesting in some sick way
My clients are aware of these plans and I have hopes that things will go without a hitch
I will be able to retrieve email and voice mail
Well I know Jack probably won't know where to pee since won't have Rosco to aim at
Not likely but you know how the baby stuff goes
You mentioned that his pop is a big dog so I guess we should expect him to be big
I just hope his personality stays the same
I agree about skipping Sharon
It is his Spring break after all
I will tell her
Hey don't worry Michael can teach you about artificials
Just ask him
I don't know about you taking Rosco
I mean it doesn't matter to me you understand
But what will Kalie and Jack do without him
It hit me today as I was watching him with Jack
My dad is having some health issues so they couldn't commit to next week
I cleared cancelling the conference with Elizabeth so please take the steps necessary to call that off
Aren't you going to see your dad with Michael next week
Delmis is cleaning as we write - I spoke to Paige
I told her we would buy
So your not buying it I see
Oh well I tried
Guess I've got it as bad as you
Do you have the GE contracts in the CA stuff
Please distribute accordingly on your side
Also I never received my original signature pages plus other consent documents
Also I'm trying to get our copy of the executed CA Development I and CA Development II contract documents
Maybe a copy of it
I almost felt like saying -- Sorry John but here's some more bad news
This is the only contract text issue I am aware of
Please let me know your opinion
I got the same response from Mike and Ken
When I tried to print the option agreement it came through as gibberish
Could you try sending the doc again
Specifying it is for infrastructure costs may cause heartache
Anytime in the next hour is good since I didn't eat breakfast
I would love a caffeine free Diet Coke
When do you want it
Do you have a Diet Coke
I can give you my badge and you can charge it
What would you like and when do you want it
I'll go down and get you something
Hint His stuff is still here but he isn't
Up to you
I called and left Steve a brief message
I'll patch you in when he calls back
I saw your posting concerning the kayak
Do you still have it
Where is it located
I may be interested
Do they want one of the turbines before Sept
I apologize for the oversight
Did you look at it on the website
So do you want a kayak for Spring Break next week
I'm sure REI has what we need
Do you want to go by and look at it
I'm still on it
Did we ever send the letter that John Rigby drafted
We would like to take a look at it
Sounds like something fun for our family
I'll call to set up a day/time if that's ok with you
I may go straight there in the am
I appreciate your very quick response
Apparently my client was satisified with the service he received
I'll arrange an invite if you are interested
Please let me know if you need something different or additional
I sent it to J Cogan but I can send it to other folks as well
I think he will absolutely love it
They showed some kids on TV and they were quite taken with it
Should have let you know
Kay if you have a signed version of the agreement you may want to forward a copy to Theresa
If you can't attend in person we'll set up a call in number
Please let me know your availability at your earliest convenience
Also please feel free to invite others which you feel should be involved in this kick off discussion
I have a change in plans next week
My dad is having surgery in Ft Worth so I will be heading that way on Monday
I will manage client expectations accordingly
Yes but this time it is his carotid artery - the one that transports blood to the brain
I hope your dad's surgery goes well
The ones that I made changes to are in red
Kay--I finally got it to blackline correctly
Are either of you familiar with this project
I am not in the office today so please include Renee Alfaro on your response
Please let me know if you have any other potential conflicts
Look at you
I believe this to be the applicable assignment language
Of course I could have missed it
I think it is her heart
Are you having fun yet
I looked that up and it's an ugly dog
He definitely doesn't have that face it looks more like a Jack Russell
He's like Ric you can only push him so far
Just thought I'd update you on the kids
Do you need something for lunch
They haven't said much and I haven't asked
Afraid to I guess
I cried for weeks
Oh I miss Ruthie when we go on trips
I swear they are like children
If Jake wants to negotiate something else with GE I'm all for it
You lost me
We talked to Jake about it and the two issues were GE consent and accounting treatment
At least that's how I remember it
I didn't redact it but Ben might have a copy
I can email you the electronic file of the intact document
If the tickets are still available I would love to have them
I agree that he really should see it
If you want to take him that's great or we will be glad to take him
I keep forgetting to discuss this with you
The Lion King will be here for the entire month of July and Michael MUST see it
I don't care whether you two take him or me but it's an absolute
This will be my third time to see it
Do you know yet when you will be on vacation
I would love to
He is going to flip over it
I figured it was a long shot
Let me know how your review is proceeding
Ok by now you think I've lost my mind
I can accept that
I think that's a good way to go
I will be glad to do it if you want
Bill has received their comments but I don't know his reaction
Have you seen the comments
I think Jake wants you to weigh in no matter what
He obviously values your opinion
Is that a general offer to help or just an offer to help me find the Blue Dog contract
Just let me know what if anything I can do to help you out
I now can't remember what it is
Anyway it needs to be on the list for next week
Sounds like we are now reunited in the same legal group EWS
I really like that one
Also I like working for Mark Haedicke
I haven't received an email from David Hunt yet
You were reading my mind
What is the list of things he owes us
David F and I will call Marvin to report on the status
I don't have any significant comments but I picked up a couple of minor typos
PS I hope Mark isn't reading this today
I should be available most of the day so let's see how things go
If we do not hear from David Hunt this morning is there someone running backup for you
I would include in this email but I don't have an electronic version with me
Reagan if you have an electronic version could you forward it to me
I cannot imagine a shirt larger than the one you received
I sure hope that they got JD's size right
I'll have to check with Lance and see what he got
Any idea how close it is to B & P's office and how much it costs
This is the hotel where you will stay in DC
I haven't seen the flights but I'm sure they are fine
I will defintely check them out
FYI it would bother me if Marvin called our outside counsel
If you want me to call David just ask
It uses up relationship capital and it causes the counterparty to incur expenses they may not want to incur
He committed to getting those to us directly
If I were starting over again there are a few things I would change
Second I would put all the put/call details in the llc agreement
Third I would make the put/call available anytime GE agreed to it
This is how it worked on the Intergen deal
Sounds like a plan but do not sign a breakout contract in an Enron entity until you hear further
It seems that me and mine belong to Messr
Haedicke and you guys
Will fill you in as the day progresses
Where did you end up
Are you still with Vicki
Seems like a long shot but she really wants to do it
Michael has a kid in his class named Colin Waters
Unfortunately I haven't met him yet
I can't wait to hear about your reunion
I know it will be a blast
I sure hope it is this week
Attached for your reading enjoyment is an indicative org chart
As you might guess there have been some changes since this was published in December
Tomorrow is bad for me but Thursday afternoon or anytime Friday is good
I have comments and will convey the comments at the meeting
I will try to be on at least part of the phone call on Thursday technology permitting
Carlos and I are discussing options right now
However they have not agreed to the corp guarantee
Sorry I didn't come up with more concrete examples
I'm really concerned about my dad although I try to deny it
I'm sure he will do a great job
In my absence you can feel comfortable talking to Jeff
Plus he knows a lot about Enron stuff
You will want to discuss the risk memo with him copying Sheila I guess
Like I said before I'll back you up on whatever decisions you make for whatever that's worth
I have in hand the Ledford agreement
I think the best description is the general Enron Corp description
Lots of help I am
If you can easily find that blub would you mind forwarding it
Kay Thank you again for participating in our Roundtable discussion
Please e-mail me what you would like written about your company
If you could get it to me by the end of Tuesday that would be great
Here is the current draft for your review
As you can see I now have email access
I also got your voice-mail
Also rest assured we intend to give you ample notice of project location etc
Let me know if you're still shopping for counsel there
Please call me on Monday to discuss if possible
Again we can discuss this on Monday
I really hadn't intended for Carolyn to work on this transaction
I look forward to hearing your comments soon
I know you are on holiday so if you have something else going on I wouldn't worry about it
I can always call you later
I heard about this call yesterday
Am I to participate
However since these are TurboPark turbines I wanted to make sure you are aware of the deal
Here's my only comment which I sent directly to Karen
Is she home yet
Do you have her home number/address
Sorry to hear about your dad
If so I will ask Carolyn Campbell not to participate in the call
I'm still out of town but now I have email access
Did your CA get taken care of
Do you have electronic copies of the development agreement
When will he be calling in
Let me take a look at the agreements first before we commit
He might have copies and he won't charge us for them
At least I don't think he will
Thanks for your understanding and patience this week
I'll call B &P to see if they have electronic versions
If all goes well with the exclusivity agreement we might go over a few contract points with NorthWestern
I apologize for talking to outside counsel without your permission
I hope you dad is doing well
I sent it to Ken and Mike
I haven't heard back since then
Where do we stand with this
Did you send an updated version to Ken
Would you consider using him
I think it is an East deal so I wouldn't think it would be dumped on you
I just think it is nice to see the good stuff
In fact just PLAN to not be there and if you are it is a bonus
I don't know what I think about this email
I will say that I've heard good things about Clark but haven't worked with him
Could we possibly talk about this project at your convenience
I would be happy to drop by to discuss staffing timing etc
Many thanks - look forward to hearing from you
I'm not sure I like her availability stuff as inserted
Maybe we should leave some space for some wording but not give them actual language today
It is such a big issue I hate for us to get into a box which won't work
I still haven't seen anything
I have to build up to the good stuff
Did you find the fax
Call and let me know
If so what are your numbers
Marisa can swear much better than me in Spanish
Unless something new comes up I think we finished the letter agreement
The changes look fine to me
This deal will need it
If so please let me know the time and the dial-in number
Kay & Jeff I assume that you saw this but just in case you did not
Could you take care of this
Carlos has Illinois so keep him copies please
Per your e-mail below you indicated that Hillary Fehr called you and asked what you needed from her
Regarding any legal documentation I have a call in to Karen Way requesting that she provide her input
I think my suggested cover letter said that
How much longer before we send the deal out
I'm really looking forward to seeing the Rangers and what a great place to see them
If not please let me know times you would be available
I thought about you every day but I figured you'd be better off with peace and quiet
He is very relieved to have it over with
Are you still in a lot of pain
It takes a while to get your strength back so don't push it
It is amazing all the things you use those muscles for
I can't tell you how much I miss you
I've got to go lay down though I think I've been up too long
How's your dad
If they hope to sink Enron's plans city officials concede the task won't be easy
That has Coral Springs Mayor John Sommerer worried because his city is often downwind from Pompano Beach
Please call me when you have a minute
David Fairley and I will call to follow-up
Could you re-send that summer camp website address
The one I got on the page didn't work
Do you know the hours of summer camp
I put a call in to ask just in case you didn't know
I kinda like the Methodist angle and the swimming pool
Maybe we should try church there
I found the receipts
I'll leave that up to you
I can't wait-shall we come over
I think EECC had the typewriter on the original contract
I quickly looked in my TurboPark binders but didn't immediately find the ABB contract
The footer you described sounds like an AK footer
I assume that either A&K or LLGM had the typewriter
Speakers expressed concern about their health and their children's health
The DEP is scheduled to work on its final permit
At the request of Marguerite Kahn I am attaching a memorandum and the document referred to therein
Are these ok with you
These are both pending but just so you know they exist I'm sending this along
Once these are signed I'll send you copies
I found it on her desk
Unfortunately she has since had surgery and isn't in the office
The receipts are no longer on her desk and the current temporary assistant doesn't know anything about it
My bet is it will be cancelled
I would love to take my bride out to dinner
If you do yoga Thursday we could do dinner Friday
Let me know what you think and I will write Charlotte
Did you read Charlotte's email
I hope the freeway wasn't too bad
Maybe we can make some of Brain's ball games
I think Michael would enjoy going
I don't see a problem with it
I will fax it on to you immediately upon receipt
I had planned to take care of the publication of notice
Please let me know if that is not allright
So what night is better for you
They approved it and he signed it
Let me know if you didn't
In order to identify and coordinate all of this we would like to have a team meeting
If I left anyone off of the distribution list please have them attend and I'll get them added
If I don't get to everyone before then send any ideas/issues to me by email
A strange place for it
Can you open this attachment
If possible I will take at least one of those days
On the summer camp if we use a camp by you we will probably lose Charlotte for the summer
Does that matter to you
I really think I have died and gone to hell
Not clear if you all received this directly
If someone can give me the name and address of Montana Power I can finish the exclusivity agreement today
Obviously he might have some other comments as well
I'm happy to send him the latest or maybe he can access the site
I suspect an Enron person
I didn't know there was one
I do not have the override letter for this
I attach the form of the AAB agreement from Fountain Valley
Peter if you have the override agreement for that deal can you e-mail to thsi circulation
Bart the project managers would like to get this form to ABB who is in our offices today
Can you let us know
Come see me whenever you want
Here's a draft for your review
If no space is available they are to go in at noon
Can you review it when I get it ready
I will ask Kathleen Carnahan to prepare a draft agreement
I look forward to the discussion tomorrow
Please call if you have any questions prior to the meeting
The Option looks fine to me with two minor exceptions
I'll come if I can
I can try to attend another meeting if necessary
I'm not as good at traveling as you
I have not heard back from our HR rep yet
Here's the form of LOI I was thinking of using in draft form
Does that mean I'll see you there
Carlos says he will be here tomorrow unless something happens tonight
I will be out of the office tomorrow and Monday
I had a conference call with John Carolyn and Rick Vincens and we are pushing forward
If you read this could you tell me about any critical issues
Note their lawyers are Paul Hastings
This is one of the ones I cancelled since I haven't taken Wellhead to Burner Tip yet
We have changed our e-mail address
I've got several deals going great guns so you know how that goes
I had lunch with Stuart and Kathleen today and that was fun
Neil and I have a date night tomorrow so we are trying to decide what to do
I suggested we just walk around the downtown hot spots if the weather is nice
I figure if that doesn't do it nothing will
Neil gets to go with me which is really nice
Daylight savings time starts next week so I guess the sun will be setting as the game ends
I'm glad baseball season is back although I did gave away our tickets to tomorrow's game
You bottle of bubbly is in my kitchen
I keep hoping to have an hour to bring it by
I think some of the work I do is transferring with me but I'm not sure
In short I don't know what the difference will be
I'm liking the sound of it
I miss you terribly as does Neil
It isn't the same without you
I don't know who has or wants to look at the deal docs but here's the main one
Herman this is the transaction we discussed on the phone a couple of weeks ago
I know it can be done we just have to figure out the paper trail
Chip I haven't received the Hancock letter yet
Stephen your close review of the document would be greatly appreciated
Anyway I don't intend to communicate with Carlos about the Delta deal
He has his hands full
I have a fire drill for you
I glanced through the interconnect
I don't know why I have trouble with your email address
I left you a voice mail message
That will make it easy for me to search
If you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact me
Please advise if this doesn't work for you
Maybe I was wrong
Please direct any comments or questions regarding this procedure to me
If you have any questions regarding the above please do not hesitate to call me
Have I written you back yet
It is such a zoo I can't remember
Both Neil and I will be there
I love those seats
I'm sure you will be at a game soon
How many games do you have tickets to this year
I ate most of two hot dogs
I bet I'll be sleepy soon
I brought them back up here so my office will probably still smell like chili when you come back
That way I wouldn't be all alone
She's throwing up from the pain meds I think
We haven't given her any more but you can see her cringing as she breathes
Bless her heart I know how she feels
Well you won't be moving until I get back so it'll be interesting to see what happens
I wonder if you'll get a promotion
I bet women problems won't even phase Ben but maybe we can always hope
Usually you say female problems and the men run the opposite direction
I just got finished paying bills
Boy do I have a lot of them
I feel pretty good so it should be ok
Tell Neil I miss his calls too
Did Carlos' wife ever have her baby
Can I come with you to assist you
Where do we go from here today
I got a form that consultants sign and I'll compare them
Larry left me a voice mail
I don't know that I like the idea either
I told him I don't want to go there now
I feel bad
I'll at least leave a message for him this weekend
Any more thoughts on what you would like to do tonight
What are your feeling about Montana Power's counter
I would love to take you up on it but I'm already lined up to go
My recollection is that each of you is somewhat of a baseball fan as I am
I would love it if each of you could join me
I will bring my legal pad to take notes
Hope you can come
Also I had it revised to take out E Next and substitute the llc
So now I have two versions
Just trying to get it clear
I believe it is one and the same
Kay and Catherine several comments jumped out from my quick review of the below for each of you
I assume it is the current contract which has been executed through assignment by E-Next Generation LLC
To make it more fun there are complications with the GE consent on the Pastoria deal
It is not a happy time between GE and Enron but I hope it will smooth over quickly
They are really taking their time
It makes me think that they would sign up as is
Have you seen your ticket
It isn't in my name is it
Thank you for choosing Continental Airlines
Wow you are up early for a man of leisure
That's my One Pass number
This is my flight and the ticket is in my name
Just getting out of our Monday meeting
I'm reviewing it now
I wouldn't call them until after you've taken the flight
I will call our travel agt to see what's up
Therefore I would be interested in your response to the attached
I understand that Lee is in New Orleans today but I'll send him a copy anyway
If you don't get it tomorrow let me know
I recall some email traffic on this
Maybe you can poll Steve Thome Bill Williams and Jake Thomas to get these answers
I didn't tell them so the rumor mill must be working
Could you please be a guest at our table
I guess go back to the original contract performance numbers
I would think the policy would still be in place but I don't remember what it is
Rumor mill is working but you were the leak
I'll call after I get done with my PSEG call
I think the amounts and pricing stays the same
Let me know how the pricing schedule will be affected
Feel free to add it and return to me
I would like to see their opinion letter
I suspect the letter agreement will be signed sometime this week
It is up to you
Kay Is there anything different from the forms you and I worked on earlier
Danetta worked it for the Fountain Valley project
How long has she been here
I didn't know there was anyone other than you
What deal was it on
I don't have anything on CA Development
I don't remember executing any attorney's opinions
We are looking forward to seeing you and Earl this weekend
If it isn't too much trouble could you email me the menu
Today was the first day I had seen them
Just to be sure I never saw these before correct
Have you seen anything from Hancock re Delta
Let me know how what you think
That should be our starting point
No I don't have anything yet
Did you hear differentlly
I haven't checked to see if the PS Stabilizers are included
I'll finish this and forward you some other docs
Otherwise I like the document
John expects to use something similiar on the coal plant but obviously that is up to you
Ben called this am and said we can go ahead
I remember that the longer I played softball the bigger the women were
But she's not as tall as the picture makes her look
Some of the other girls are only about my height
If genetics means anything I think her build will be more along the softball player lines
I had a momentary lapse
It would be great if we could talk this week
I'm under the gun right now but will you be available on Friday for a chat
My conflicts check turned up no problems so I'm looking forward to working with you
I have looked over the LOI you sent
Please let me know who you want to proceed from here
I'll let you know when I receive the corrected letters
Any idea why she didn't go
The performance values have been modified as I believe the previous draft had site-specific numbers
It is redlined against the version you received last Friday
I'll forward the operative docs to you right away
Based on who is throwing out the first pitch we better be early
Please feel free to call me with any questions.
I know Michael would be delighted
We could take them to the Pink House if they preferred
If there's anything I can do please let me know
You and your family stay in our thoughts and prayers
I can't imagine what you your dad and sister must be going through
I know they were close to your mom and spent a lot of time with her
What a wonderful gift of memories they must have and what joy they must have brought to her life
Thank you for your thoughts and concerns and your cards and for talking with Lisa
It was tough for her being away from everything and she really needed you and your mom and dad
We are looking forward to having you back again
If there are any changes let me know
I have a conflicting call at that time tomorrow thus I will not be able to participate
Maybe we can grab something quick and eat upstairs
I am underwater
I'm going in today can we meet for lunch
I only expect to use bullets below the issues I've identified
Those young uns recover quickly don't they
I was up all day yesterday and didn't feel too tired
She's not yelping any more when she gets off the bed
That's about all of my news
Warren helped a little yesterday and Theresa has offered to do my expense account
I'll limp by miserably until your return
Girl you are putting in the hours
We are on for lunch on Monday aren't we
Still miss you too
I wish I was there to help you
Janette told me Julia and Lance is out tomorrow also nut I'll check with him
Are we having a call today
If so let me know the time and dial-in info
I don't have an electronic version yet either
If you don't get it today I'll fed ex a copy to your office for when you return
Hopefully it won't be too bad
Could someone email me the latest version of the AIP
Lee sent it
I hear your deal blew up
Steve is in my office and he agrees with the approach
Please advise of your thoughts on this issue
Perhaps you can think of more
Additionally I would like to have someone in the Houston office involved for backup
I had that same version so I accepted changes and updated to reflect our current agreement
There are questions and blanks in it
Call or page me
Well don't get too excited until you read it
There's lots of stuff I just had to put place holders on but we'll get it all filled in
I don't really like the organization of it much
I think things need to be moved around and re-organized
Call me when you get a few minutes...I need a lesson
Prior to speaking with Bill I also spoke with Greg Lang
Maybe he cancelled this week since he is out next week
I need a legal opinion
Do I need to use an EID for non-purchase orders
Do I need to use an EID for purchase orders
What if I do not know my EID
What do I do if an invoice comes directly to me
Also how many execution copies will we have
Please let me know if you have any corrections
In the event these revisions are acceptable we have also enclosed a clean copy for execution
If this letter has not yet gone out we should include the kitchen sink of perceived problems
That way you can look at both at the same time and sign both at the same time
I haven't quite figured out the route but I think this is the correct destination
For the Guaranteed Delivery dates I have used the Ready to Ship Dates contained in the Agreement in Principle
I may have a cleaned up version
It's high time we had some fun around here
Please get a preliminary head count and contact Papa's to determine if and when they can accommodate us
Would you please email the second draft to him at home
This is the most recent email I have from Mark
Hi Kay I wanted to follow up with you on the group bookings
I so far have confirmed bookings for yourself Heather Kroll and Anne Koehler
I have a couple of Hawaiian shirts so I'll probaly pick one of those
What do you want to do about lunch tomorrow
You know how she frets about such things
Or we could pick up Sonic if someone is hungry
What are you guys bringing to wear to dinner
I was thinking nice shorts or something like that
I think Bobby has a computer working for the Pink House
I think we will be ready to go in the morning
I'll call you when we leave
I believe he is going to Reliant
I'll expand the list to include your suggestions
I would really appreciate your advice
I have to learn it somehow and I know that you have an excellent idea of what works
I need to run some tax stuff by you so here 'tis
Maybe after you look at things we can discuss it
Hope it works
I just called Mom and told her our plans
She vacuumed on Monday or Tuesday and he asked her who she was expecting to visit the next day
She say Larry and Beverly left today so we can park in their driveway and be sneaky
My exit strategy didn't work and I got these back
Also what other documents will we have here
Do I have any hope of getting out of the opinion
I appreciate your advice especially on the opinion
I will email you the current draft of the instructions
I know nothing about Pegasus Power or Salmon
What comfort are we getting that we will get paid
Are these guys going to expect he same from GE
Do we need to give a place for meetings and if so where should these meetings be
We don't want to give them any room to wiggle
Would you rather do lunch tomorrow
I feel puny now but maybe I'll feel better later
Would this create a problem for us
I know your pictures will be spectacular
How does that look for you
I feel so needed
Oh we went to Brenham and shot some bluebonnet pics yesterday
I hope they come out good
Linda Simmons has been requesting them for a while now
Did you see the Masters golf tournament
Tiger won and it was exciting
I never thought I would actually like watching golf
Also could you look at the stuff I've highlighted in yellow
I haven't put all your comments in but I will in a minute
Neil was so sweet bringing me hot washcloths
I'm running a low grade fever and I know it is a sinus infection
I spent a lot of time outside yesterday and I'm paying for it
I figured Bob Carter would leave
I bet she's a crazy woman
Oh you should see the roots on my hair
I'm so glad I'm getting it done on Thursday
I look like a skunk
Thank goodness my hair is curly
I was thinking about putting on some makeup to go to the doctor but I think not
I'll do good to get my hair dry
Are you feeling any better
I figured you knew but I thought I'd better be certain
Oh I heard it from Dan, so you probably know
Are they looking for someone to replace Pat
I don't know his skills but he is great on the phone
I hate it when I do that
Where is the doc you need faxed
It has loosened up somewhat to our benefit
Bucket two is essentially where we have been up to now
NOTE Please keep us in the loop on new deals as we roll out this new model
Please distribute to those I have missed
Let's see if I can attach it this time
Here are my comments to the consent and assignment agreement
Thanks I'll pass along your comments
I have copies and will get them to you
Have you checked to see if the checks cleared the bank
Could I get a copy of copies you kept
I think I'll just take off until you get back
However he still wants me to take it easy for a couple more weeks
The ball is clearly in their court so I guess we just stand by
I plan on being back in the office tomorrow
Heard you were ill-sorry to hear that
I haven't heard a thing re Blue Dog
I should be in the office in the am
You can ease into things again without us hovering
Wait until you see me I'm a shadow of my former self with all that swelling gone
I feel so much better
I can't eat very much any more either
I can drink though
Steve I know that we specifically included the stabilizer in the Salmon deal
Anyhow you look at it though the timing is good
Do you still have the contact info for the escrow agent
If so it would be great it you would contact them directly
I expect that it may well be ready tomorrow
I expect the Enron opinion letter to be an issue
When you get a chance please advise of any comments in order that we can circulate for PPL's review
Let me know if we can assist in this regard
It has been included in our price to Delta
Could you call Bill and discuss
Please call me should you have any questions
If it looks good to you can you please print on ENA letterhead
I can drop by to sign at that time
I haven't heard when they expect to have their financing
I want to push them hard to close
I do not know what Delta needs for siting their generation
I am trying to locate chapter and verse on that requirement
Don Hammond will help me locate the requirement in the morning and I will get back to you
I want to stay silent on that issue
Even then we could send faxes to the right numbers
I hope I'm in town
You will get them next Wed at class
Did you ask Lee for a finance contact
The fax is coming in as we speak
Does that mean do or does it mean not
You are confusing me
As I'm sure you recall Bob Vote handled the last one
Richard Sanders is the EWS litagation manager so Mark would probably like for him to know about it
The court may impose penalties for violations of its garnishment order
You're a better man than I am Gunga Din
Depends on how much time you give me
Can you get the Form of Parent Guaranty
I have not yet integrated all of his changes although I have dealt with the profit/savings and QSE
When we were part of Julia's group waivers of consequentials in CA's were not standard
In the reciprocals it would depend on the circumstance
If the other party is doing most of the sharing I would want it
What say you Carlos
Believe it or not they have not mentioned an extension
They figure we can sign on Friday
Have they asked for an extension yet
Please either resend the documents to Kay Mann John Keffer and myself
Chris in case Kay is not in today I provide this to you
Please forward to Ben at your earliest convenience
Note We will forward to you shortly revised drafts of the documents for which we have drafting responsibility
I will be out of town on Thursday and Friday and will therefore be unable to attend
This will ensure that you receive important iBuyit Payables information
Last night my little boy was sick so I guess it was a virus
I feel good today
Have you made it back into the office today
I know you are probably really busy
I don't know Paige's plans beyond Thursday
I love free stuff even agreements
Read it file it or throw it away
Completely your call
I was out when you called the other day
Since then we have another version of the docs anyway
Monday is bad for me
How's it looking
Are you and Herman ok with this
I haven't forgotten you I just got tied up
This is a very preliminary draft but thought you should take a look at it
I don't need any memos just a discussion
I believe we need to restore the stabilizer stuff but I wanted to get agreement
Again Kent is negotiating this directly so I don't know what the current version looks like
I guess I just need a bit more sleep
I'll forward your email to Neil
Charles appreciates your help in this good cause and so do I
Please advise if you are available or if not what time would be convenient later today
Here's some stuff for us to discuss
Want to join me
It isn't necessary unless you want to
Do you want me involved
This is the first of two emails I'm sending you
Otherwise we'll wait for your instructions
Since it's a small group we decided not to use a call-in number
Do you want to come to my office for the call
If so could you PLEASE PLEASE bring me a caffeine free diet coke
I told them you were talking to GE about it and we will get them the contract ASAP
It is also their biggest issue
Do you know if Lee knows about this
Please reserve us a conference room on this floor
I think Lima would make a great bobble head
I'm clueless why he sent it to me
Have you gone to your reunion yet
Hope you find all your Easter eggs
And he hung them
How is your Dad
This SHOULD be it
I will make these changes this morning
Could you please print all of these attachments for me
I hope this is the last version
Do you have a copy
If not I can probably get a copy from EECC
I hope to take tomorrow off by the way
Does that mean we will do the pre-pay
I spoke with Jake and Lee about the payment schedule
We can probably push him to get it earlier
I don't know either
These are the current drafts not the ones I sent earlier
Carolyn I think we should tender by email
Thanks for all your efforts and consistent responsiveness
I hope you have a great vacation
As I told you last week I will be on vacation tomorrow and all of next week
I will be checking my voice-mail at least twice a day
We are working on some of it
Please email your home addresses
If they get their financing in order it will fund sooner
I would go with Sheila's approach
I don't see a reason not to
Do we have a company for New York yet
Am I remembering that correctly
I think this will change a bit but it gives you some history
We had our daily phone call with NW
I don't know that we really have significant points of disagreement
Chris could you forward the draft change orders with it
Other than the accting issues this should be about it
Just so long as I get paid
Can we talk early next week
I think we'll still have the breakout contracts which are essentially finished
It's okay with us
We look forward to discussing the attachments with you on Monday
I hope it is raining at the house
It looks like it probably is raining all over town
Hope you get some there
I'm glad it worked out so well
I thought it was very relaxing
I would love to have the recipe for the beef
I will probably go to North Carolina Wednesday returning Thursday or Friday
I don't know her
I missed the last one so I should make it to this one
I've been trying to puzzle my way through this
I don't think she's in
You might want to leave her a voice mail
Please let me know if you have any further comments
I would like to sign up for the new garage please
I hope it works out so you can go
I think it would be a hoot
I wouldn't worry about the call
Lisa O'Brien and myself will join from Freshfields
I am meeting with Ben tomorrow to discuss NWestern
Ms Kahn and I have exchanged voice mail
Could one of you return her call for me
Taffy please let Ann Elizabeth know that we will reschedule the meeting
Did we send the letter out Friday
Will you send me a copy
How does this look to you
Please contact me as soon as possible with your comments
CA Energy Development I L.L.C
How does it sound to you
I just realized that tomorrow is Mason's birthday party
I know Michael would love to go
Both my husband and I work but I will attempt to take off and bring him
I guess she didn't make my reservations
Obviously I do not need a car
I would like to get these reservations asap for the upgrade
I'm happy for you guys to go forward with the call
Ben and I will join later if we finish in time
We will need a follow up call anyway once we know what to do to meet the accting objectives
Finalizing the extension sounds good to me
I bought presents for this and the Houstonian party which is next Wednesday
I don't remember where this one is being held
Do you know the hours
Or what do you think about me asking Charlotte to switch days
I need the corp docs for Salmon Energy
Do one of you gentlemen have this
I hate to spring it on her
Maybe suggest it for next week at the Houstonian
To clarify the Edgecombe we were discussing is in North Carolina
Are we resuscitating an asphyxiated deal
Carlos Sole will be working on it so I'll let him answer the timing issue
Paul can you confirm that wiring instructions in the agreement are suitable
I need Enron to confirm that these fees are acceptable
I had a vegetarian sandwich
Please tell me that this isn't the morale booster
What will we accept
Also Delta has suggested that we add in language for the adjustment due to site conditions
When writing the LOI please don't limit it to a certain block size for the plant
Once again I expect to be on an endless conference call but I can work while I talk
In connection with the review we need to finalize those confidentiality agreements
Carlos gave me a file folder with the Salmon filing docs
I need it by Friday if at all possible
Could I get a updated closing list
I will work on a first draft of this one too
Could you please print these for me
Am I on the right track
Have we seen the security agreement yet
I hear I should have sent this to you
No we have not received a draft of that or the PPL promissory note
I just called Ben
I'm waiting for him to call me back
What do you have in mind
I missed you and your wiseass comments
I may go home and work after I take Michael
What is your time frame please
I guess I'd better cancel
I requested copies of the note security agreement and the non-disturbance lien document
I advised that the ENA consent is satisfactory
Can you handle signature
Jake we put a couple of Houston guys just in case something comes up
We have assumed that you will be executing the docs
If there's any problem with the list please let me know
Can he certify his own name
If so we want him to also be a signatory
Kathleen please verify the way these guys like to sign their names and current titles
Let me know if you think we should use someone else
Chris we need a name and a call back number for whoever will be watching for the wires
Please let me know if you don't have the earlier versions
Let me think about it
Congratulations on your new adventure
Can you sneak me a copy of the latest draft
Maybe I can negotiate with Ben
More questions to come but I wanted to get this to you asap
Reagan you might want to look through the comments you gave me for more open items
Last week I wrote down EXACTLY the flights I wanted didn't change my plans
In fact I've spent more time investigating my options by myself than I ever had before
Let me know ASAP if you want to change so they won't charge your card etc
Thank you Kay
Are you going to be a GRANNY
I will complete the certificate
Where do you want this to go
Would it be a projection of MDEA's Native Load
Are we providing it or is MDEA
You better leave your office unlocked tonight
I'm trying to get things lined up on multiple fronts and all roads lead to you
I think this is one of your comments
What does it mean
This Assignment shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto their successors and assigns
I do not have any comments to the notice
Please contact me with any questions regarding the enclosed
Please print and set up like you did the Northwestern stuff
I will duplicate the GE letter
I appreciate that the timing of this structure is complicated
We will be buying electricity to serve their load
Jim Homco questioned whether we should buy the fuel oil
How should it be used in the agreement
What financial security will be required of them
Are we attaching Marketing Strategy and Trading/Risk policy or establishing a time line
Are we absorbing it
If so could I get the latest version
Can you track down the info
How does it look to you
Is there anything we need to get them to consent to
She called me too
I am just now getting started with work
He first told Norris he rubbed it
Then he said he poked himself in the eye
I wasn't blaming you
I can't help it if we have a new travel agent
I don't want to let up on Delta however
I think she will have a great time
She'll probably know some of them
I enjoy the parties
In fact I enjoy these kid birthday parties
Speaking of Reagan he is generating exhibits
If you have please respond to Sara today if possible
Gee one more item for your review
I'm looking forward to meeting you
I haven't given up hope yet
I believe it is the E-Next Generation LV Co Gen contract
I believe the last draft was around the beginning of April
I can check for more specifics
Please let me know which contract needs to be changed and I'll take care of the rest
Here's what we're hearing from our contractor
Can you work them in Peter
But here's he input for consideration
Could you please make certain they are included
She may turn out to be great just because she becomes extra cautious with us
Yea maybe I was trying to make excuses for TAP
You are right I have changed things in the past and have had no problems
Maybe this woman will turn out ok She seems to be listening to what I say to her
You probably need to get an overview of the entire deal as you may want some outside help
Doug and I will provide you background
I have not yet furnished the re-draft to Greg
I can't find a flaw with that approach
Guess we might want to lob this one in to Delta just for fun
Can you help me with these
I need to get them fixed up today
Kay I am not sure if any additional items are necessary
That is all I can think of at the moment
I would like to introduce you to Carlos Sole if you haven't met him yet
It wouldn't be the same without you
Did you know Ozzie is going to EES
And if so its name
OK We'll standby until you give us additional instructions
I just opened this
Kay no comments from DF today so far...I am reading now and feeling pretty good about it
Can we meet after that
I'm awaiting final approval from Finance but I think we should get this in front of GE
Ben do you or Chris want to handle this or shall I
I decided to go a different route
Well aren't you the quick one
We had a list previously but I believe some of the folks on it have moved on
I have not received a response from GE
We are awaiting responses to our drafts
Carolyn please correct/add anything you think is important
I'm thinking we are short lawyers
Can you see the mountains today
Do you have enovate agreement handy
Could you fill in the blanks for me in this document with the correct names jurisdictions of organization etc
Aren't you on holiday
I was kinda hoping you would fill in the blanks
Looks like they have re-surfaced
Are you standing up at your desk today
I even rode with Jeff for a few miles
I have not seen anything form anyone
Christi N said she would be done this morning
I do think the banks' lawyers weighed in
Could you please print this email and the attachments for me
Do you have the standard offer service agreement
Didn't I mark his up all ready
I understand that you are just back from holiday so obviously this comes at a bad time
See you in SA
Gee makes you wish there was a way to track documents without having to speak to someone
There's time to wait for her to answer though
I hope this is the last thing
I could be off track but that's how I remember it
Otherwise I would have called you
She told me herself so it must be true
I think your memory is correct
You asked me to get this stuff to Ed which I did
I asked Carlos if he still speaks espanol
You should have seen his face
He looked like he had swallowed a bug
Isn't she the attorney who did the Mexico stuff
I think he is a little overwhelmed right now
Please let me know if I'm wrong
Do you have a copy of the one with Virginia Power
We don't have to read these do we
I will call to discuss
Hope you have a good book to read
I fly back Saturday morning
So you see not really that busy just occupied
I am not quite a wreck and no promotion or raise
I'll be at the Lake Austin Spa weekend after next so that keeps me going
Are you a wreck yet
Have you got a promotion yet
Oh yes Kaye is very sorry to see her go
Is KE sorry to see her go
Sounds like you to need to buy yourself some new clothes
The spa is always something to look forward to isn't it
I wish I could get a massage but I can't lay on my stomach yet
I couldn't agree more
I'm feeling pretty thin but then I start my period on Wednesday
I have some important personal stuff to take care of
When do you plan to execute
We hope to have it executed today or tomorrow
I would like to get organized for signing docs today GE Enron and Delta
Hard copies are fine I just figure electronic will be easier
I had conversations with GE re turbine contract and I expect it will be finished up this am
Could you provide me with something along that line
When would you like to have it
I forgot about Grandma
Hamburgers sound good to me
I think MAM does ok in the morning he just needs his hours of sleep
I had to drag him out of bed this morning
He is not a morning person like his mom
I think he is more like his sister in that regard
We made it on time and he even finished breakfast
Remember I will be taking grandma to the doctor today
Kathleen has coached me on questions about these documents
First do we have a Confidentiality Agreement with ConEd that covers these power development project discussions
I understand Herman Manus is the expert on this topic
I didn't sense that they have an issue with the identity of the assignee just the ability to pay
I sent a copy to Lee Johnson when first received
I asked Lee if the comments had any merit
What is our performance obligation to E;Next
Have we spoken to GE re consents
In any event we are looking for GE's blessings on this addition
Ok I give up
Sounds good to me although we are likely to find different purchasers want other stuff as well
I need this document today in a big way
Can you assist in getting it located
If Kay doesn't have it it is possible that Lisa Mellencamp might
Circulate to me Bill Dale Lee Kent Shoemaker
Do we have a final execution version of the letter agreement
Please look into these sections in their entirety
Perhaps we should confirm this
If you have not sent them to her please do so ASAP
As per Steve's request please find below our wire instructions for the fees
You'll be pleased to know that I understood his questions
The only one I have heard from is Ed Sacks
He has some good issues that I cannot answer
Would you mind re-sending
I can't find it on my system anywhere
Please let us know when the change orders have been executed
Therefore I have not enclosed the GE Consent and Agreement in this package
In speaking with Herman he suggested that you look at the earnings on Blue Dog on the hot list
We are thinking of changing his school and Neil and I need to go visit a new one
I expect to have comments back to her by early Monday
Once you have had a chance to read them I would appreciate a call
I need a sense of when this account can be established
I count small wins
I should arrive at the office around noon
I apologise for sending duplicate forms last night
I will resend all final versions shortly
I'll let you know both answers soon
I apologize for not attaching this document to last night's e-mail
Looks to me like they aren't ready to close their financing
Hey I thought you were out
I hope you noted that I was watching out for you
I would appreciate it if you would revert to previous language
No - I don't believe he did
We made this change to conform with our credit documentation
Anyone see it any differently
I haven't seen the escrow disbursement letter lately
Is it circulating
We've known but is has gotten to be a bigger issue as he has gotten older
Are you just finding out
It is our responsibility to pay the fees which I hope will need to be paid today
If so when do they need to be paid
I have your signature on this one
I have the executed signature pages and the certificate of incumbancy
I'll send it to you
I don't think you'll have an issue
Per my previous email
Anne I hope this helps keep you moving
Isabel didn't have it on her list
I have received these
This forms supposedly integrated the requested changes you saw previously
Also we have attached a pdf black-line of the Guarantee vs the form of guarantee in the Turbine Contract.
Do not hesitate to call us with any questions.
I shall look at the ENA documents change where relevant and re-circulate
Is this ready to go as far as your concerned
I suspect that there are several options
You will like him
I understand there is also a two day notice
I don't believe I've seen a form for that one yet
Do you remember how many originals are required
I'll get back to you shortly
I may need your help
Re my voice mail concerning masters
I'm scheduled to be in a meeting tomorrow am but I know this deal is in good hands
Page me if anything exciting happens
I'm sure he gets that from you
He'll be fine just get him the help that he needs
Let me know about Friday when you decide
These docs are ready to go and your signatures would be appreciated
Just tell me the end is in sight
In addition we can ask for an authority/enforceability opinion from MDEA's counsel
Also we have attached a pdf black-line of the Guarantee vs the form of guarantee in the Turbine Contract
Do not hesitate to call us with any questions
Please send it directly to kent.shoemaker@ae.ge.com copy to me
Can you tell me to whom we send the originals
ENA is looking to use it in a project or two and I need to give a look
Would it be possible to have the LOC by Tuesday
We received confirmation from DELTA that Hancock has funded our escrow
Please let me know of any concerns or questions
Just wanted you to be aware
Bill I don't have any information about the ABB contract
Please let me know if the finals are done
If done please provide the official e copy to me
I'm about to fall face down in my computer
I'm not as young as I used to be
I have all the necessary paperwork
It looks great and it looks very new
As I indicated to you earlier I don't have issue with those changes
I suggest these pages be removed
This also is an issue I need your help on
In addition please let me know which of the contractor's changes if any I should make to the agreement
Maybe I messed up
Bill says he agrees and accepts our comments to the A&A
Include these changes and we can get this done tomorrow
Lee Here are my comments
As I'm sure you know we are fast approaching a full notice to proceed on the LVCII project
Please review and contact me should you have any questions
This change really helps me with babysitter problems
I would think that Dale would have the legal lead since he is the project's lawyer
If the answer is me...please let me know
Who do I contact in Global finance
I don't know the location yet
I can refine the model more if required
By the way they have seen the turbine contract
Contemporaneously our immediate action is to gain some form site control on the land
Your more than welcome to participate in my call with Aaron too
I made some comments/revisions
I'm not sure I understand the profit/savings but I didn't take the time to contemplate it
Can you give the current status
I'll have my cell phone on later
Ok I'll mark you out then
I thought I did help
Kay what do you need to help with this
Is it a full equipment list or some other equipment summary
Could you please describe
I told him I would ask you guys
Glad you made it safely
Have a nice afternoon and enjoy the cool mornings while they last
Here it is again
If this one fails too please let me know and I'll have a copy messengered over
I may make the tour through the going aways esp Oz
I called the spa to make appts but got voice mail
Hope you day is going well
One week from today you will be at the spa
I know you are excited
I'm excited for you
Check to see if you have an Express Scripts Rx card
If yes it was not Done
Pardon my ignorance but is there a list of riders to select from
Thursday afternoon or Friday is good for me
I think there's lots which will need to be fixed
I can't fix it now though
Here's where I am on the ILA
That is all we will be buying from them
I just got your email so I will send it anyway
Instinctively it seems that the agent for concept would be stronger
I'll check into it for the longer term deal
Obviously it is a Mississippi law issue so I'll have to get an opinion
Does not allow for us to sell them power only buy their power and sell to others
Fuel transactions include fuel oil and I thought we weren't managing fuel oil
Doesn't include the language we need for internal approvals
As far as I know we are still on board for closing on Wednesday
Consistent with my discussions with Reagan I have revised the body of the interim agreement
Here's what I sent to Rusty on Wednesday
Better leave me off the list
Please call me if you would like to discuss
I've asked GE for the LOC by Wednesday but I haven't gotten a response
Can you get executed documents back to me on Tuesday
Do you have any thoughts on this
Can we at least get the membership certificates signed by Tuesday
I need the address of where to send the membership certificate
Does it have to be an original
I did and it is fine
It is a bit cumbersome but I think I like it
Have these been forwarded to our office
What should I tell him
Doesn't sound like our objective here
Is this assumption correct or am I missing the point
It would probably be better for me if we could reschedule since I will be out of town Wed-Mon
Sent by Ben Jacoby@ECT Unfortunately I have a public hearing in Florida that I have to attend
I remember signing the faxes and signing the originals but not the return
However last week was the WEEK FROM HELL so I easily could have missed it
It seems to me that this isn't a big deal but I would appreciate it if you could confirm
Unfortunately I have a public hearing in Florida that I have to attend
And once funds are received by GE we need the receipt of funds letter
It depends on what time I get the signatures
I would prefer that it work that way
Chris Calger is in our offices today - a terrific break
I agree as to the original deliverables
However we will be able to handle this
Don't have it but we can ask local counsel
In speaking with Marvin regarding Clarksdale's authority to raise rates he pointed to me their statutes
That would be better although I will tell them that they don't get it until closing
Did I misunderstand your question
Kathleen is coming up to help me set up
If you see Kathleen can you give her the membership certificates
I only read every other word
When do you want us to come up
I'm sending it to Rose Lisa and Catherine for their review also
Sometimes I feel so uninformed
I feel like it is elevating my professional development
I ran into Chip recently
He seems happier now that he has Erik's old job
I still cannot believe it
Maybe he doesnt remember I dont work for him anymore
Can you think of anyone else
Any chance D Duran can come with you guys
Could you email me the last version of the turbine contract
I was unaware of Tom's involvement so I want to make sure the comment was addressed
I suspect I'm creating confusion as well
I wil ask Tom to forward it to you
I have nothing to add to these contracts and want to get out of the loop to eliminate confusion
This is the same version you sent today right
I am just waiting for any additional comments
The addition is not there now and it need to be
I agree with Isabel on this point
I wasn't sure where this landed
Could you get me that cert of sec ASAP
I need to get this stuff to Carolyn soon
I know Michael wants to go to your apt this afternoon
Did I mess up
I hope I wasn't supposed to be there
Please call if I can help
If anyone is unable to attend please let me know so we can possibly reschedule for next week
So I didn't think it would be that different except I wouldn't be there to organize my stuff
I thought you knew exactly what I was planning
Plus his car is pretty small anyway
In fact I don't remember you asking us to do >this
I am Wilson Montjoy's secretary
Could you please send me your mailing address for our files
That way he doesn't need to print it out
Alternatively do you have authority to issue the opinion yourself
I trust both of you as attorneys to hold in escrow
I don't want a guaranty out there without a closing
I humbly beg your forgiveness for not calling you
Now I owe you
I will check my directory to see what I have
Matt says he does not have the letter
I haven't seen the insurance certificate she references
Anyone know where it is
I know it has been requested but I don't recall seeing that it has been delivered
It is my understanding that originals were sent to Enron
Ignore my last email
Sorry about your trip
Maybe we did but I just forgot that detail
Jake Thomas signed for us so signature block on our executed version has him instead
Hi Kay I was able to pull a few strings for you in regards to your upcoming trip
Herman this is the document I called you about
AE is out-of-pocket and has some questions about this agreement so she asked me to forward the doc
I would like to move to the new garage
If so when might you be available
I thought we weren't submitting a conforming bid
Below please find my recommendations
This is in keeping with our standard power contracts
Your right my job is completely different
I love it though
Paige is finishing her junior year at Southwestern and Michael is in kindergarten at St Francis
Hope all is well with your family
Tom declined to provide me any further insight
FYI our exclusivity agreement with Northwestern expires tomorrow
I have reviewed the documents and do not see any reason why we should not deliver them
Can you provide signed copies of these documents
If it does not work let me know
Evidently we decided to submit a bid on the original transaction structure as well as two alternatives
Also I advised him that the confidentiality statements in the letter were not great protection
Sounds like gas to me
I'd really appreciate it
I'll come around in a bit and fill you in
How was your weekend with the girls
I recall that Herman is out
Do you know when he will be back
I've added my comments
Morning would probably be better for me
Please let me know your availability and we'll set something up
I assume you're on Smith St downtown
Are you spending the night downtown
If so you may want to just park at the hotel
Enron just opened a new parking garage but I'm not sure if it is open for visitors yet
If it was me and I was working and staying downtown I would take a taxi
This is partly because I have an under-developed sense of direction and partly because of the construction downtown
I assume we can finish our business within an hour
Any special instructions on where to go in your building
I accused Carlos of being a deal killer
Therefore please forward this to your team members as you see fit
We will e-mail the conference room location when it is confirmed
I can give up my seat and sit in with the commercial team if that helps
Peter I'll make sure the group has your phone number when they meet
I'd still like to sit in when my commercial team hears it if possible
The later version obviously contained more negotiated points so I think this one is more helpful
I found this one helpful for issue identification and exculpatory language however
Should the gas company decline what is the appeal process and how long can it be expected to take
Do you have any suggestions for expediting the process
No I believe it is one of TECO's subs but I'm not sure
This gives you the gist of it
It is a custom broker by the name of Fritz but she will gladly give you the details
Obviously before we can execute a change order we have to execute a contract
I don't remember if we have addressed these issues
I do think that GE may resist the combined cycle language and I don't suggest including it
Eric can you still live with that
I left you a voice mail but thought I'd try email as well
Please call me at your convenience to discuss
If you want to remove the combined cycle language I can live with that
Let me know if they resist
Refresh my recollection
If so then we will need to see if the escrow agent has any comments
I have complained about EECC Contracts using WordPerfect
As far as I know it is the ONLY Enron group still using it
I will see that you get a converted copy
Please put it on my calendar so I won't forget
You know I just can't remember that far in advance
When are you going to take some vacation
I'm sure you need a break
Where will you stay
Well just let me know so I can put it on my calendar
You are all set with my vacation days on your calendar
I don't think they'll let him go though
Why don't you run it by George and if you get positive feedback I'll suggest it to Ben
IMHO your team needs a basic understanding of the finance and accounting issues
We had one yesterday for Legal and it was helpful
I need your help to make this work with respect to the legal group and would like your suggestions
I'll call you to discuss
I plan to have a staff meeting next week and we can discuss it at that time
Neil and I haven't discussed any details yet though
I haven't even mentioned Mac's graduation yet
I just finished a really busy time and I'm optimistic that things will resume a more normal pace
I hope to catch up on yard work this weekend maybe clean out a closet
I have the urge to purge
I would say the Katie got the Clarke math gene but Paige is a math whiz
I sent Mom a table top cactus garden
Hope it gets there
I guess I should ask Paige for ideas
Does she have any big plans
Is she going to work for Enterprise again
I can't believe that it is just about summer
Things are looking up for her academically
This will give her some high school credit for math
Now she has a test like it for French
Tonight she is in Arlington with her band
As for Bobby and me we just try to keep up with it all
I think we will be up there too
I think we will take her up on it
I think I'll get him something useful
I hope that they spoil you rotten
Oh speaking of spoiled rotten I hear you enjoyed your visit to the spa
I know you were looking forward to going
Take care and give my love to your family
Regarding calculation of the Bogey we have several issues
The whole group stayed interested which is a tribute to your preparation and delivery
Alternatively what do you suggest in Georgetown
Do you know where these are
I will be in CA and will join by phone
Please calendar for me
If you will not be here in person you will be required to call in
It should go without saying that you are welcome also
I will call you to discuss what you are working on
Who is our lobbyist
Other that that I think I'm covered
Please let me know the name of the lobbyist before terminating
I'm just lost without them
Could we schedule some time for a conference call next week
I'm travelling on Monday so please ask my assistant Suzanne Adams for a copy
I had an inkling but I would have preferred foreknowledge
In addition could you send me a copy of the agreement between the City of Rocky Mount and NCNG
Did you want Stacy to take a look at this
I believe Chris should be back today so I wanted to follow up on this
After the assignment of the contracts out of LLCs we would like to exercise our put
I made the changes you suggested
Are you available any time this week
Would you please let Suzanne know
It will probably be tomorrow since Ben will need to initial as well as me
Can you email me the sig page
Please forward any comments you may have to me
Warning the black lining may not be much help to you depending on which version you last reviewed
With apologies for the short notice any input you might want to give would be appreciated
In accordance with policy this issue is being submitted to you for your review
I thought of you yesterday
I planted an eggplant plant and a pepper plant
What a great weekend - I lived outside
How was your Mother's Day Mulching Party
Great day wasn't it
I will be working on this
Could you send him an original
Please see if you can figure out the problem
If all else fails just print and have it delivered I guess or send it to his assistant
I agree that this helps
Did you just do a tolling agreement re LV
In Texas you have to have licenses to buy/sell insurance and adjust claims
I might have missed it
Could I get a copy of the final document
It is my filing system
I still haven't gotten it back so he must have received it
I still haven't received the finance stuff yet
I'd like to call Jeff Darst today to discuss the letter he sent on LDs etc
Prior to calling him though I wanted to e-mail the acknowledgement letter and the acknowledgement and consent
Let me know when you think you can get to this and I'll schedule the call with Darst accordingly
To you remember if you brought them to me before
I haven't really searched - I thought I would ask first
Is this what you were thinking about
As you can see Jeff suggested you take a look at it before it is sent to the customer
I checked my maps of DC and it looks like the Hotel Washington might be a good alternative
Could you see what they have for Mon/Tues night
Also please check back with the Willard to see if they have had any cancellations
Could you email me your telephone number and the afterhours number
Due to the shortage of time please call me with any information you might have
I figured it would
Let's see if we hear anything by noon
We can send it to his lawyer at the same time if he wants
I think it is someone other than David though
Can you find out who he wants to receive the draft
Yazoo is near completion on the work and has already burned gas in their testing over the past weekend
Can we swap days with Charlotte and go tomorrow
At least now we will see where we stand
You should get a call from Suzanne my assistant
Sorry to be so slow in getting back to you
I have several lunch meetings but my schedule is free otherwise
We submitted a bid with caveats as to its non-binding nature and suggested an alternative structure
John Llodra has compiled answers which appear to be fine to me
But I think secretly she was looking forward to seeing her friends
I accidentally brought home a roll of Paige's film
I think it's Paiges it has a picture of Mikey on it
But it could be yours
I didn't notice C Sherman's name
I'm unclear as to whether Herman needs it also
I suggest that Pete Thompson keep the typewriter on this
We are getting so close to the end I would really like to try to avoid confusion
If you've been praying for him keep it up
And thank you
And if you haven't started now would be a great time to begin
After giving the matter due consideration I have decided not to hire either of you
Just checking because I have to prioritize my little duties
I signed the agreement this am
You're going to get it
Take your fat lawsuit-happy-pig Eric Thode and get the fuck out of South Florida
We will stop you
Suz please find a room and notify folks and their assistants
How long do you want the room for
Scott today the extension to the Agreement in Principle expires and we need to extend
Can you tee this up with Steve Swift
I drafted a fix last Friday sent to Kay M for comment
I have included my suggested changes in the attached redline
I think it works
I have entered that fix in the attached redline
The attached are redlined to show my changes
I hope this will help to advance the process
Is it Yazoo City or the YCPC or what
Peter could you take first cut at the override letter
Just for your info
Please contact me at ext
Please contact me with any questions or comments regarding this matter
When will you not have conflict
She had this conversation with Neil so I don't know the details
I knew you would figuer out something
They hid them and I just found them
I'll bring you a couple
When will they have some
I'll just tell her it isnt' ready
I asked you yesterday when you needed these binders
It's a good thing I had them almost done
This morning Dan Sheila and you are all needing things and I'm only one person
I think that's fine
With regard to turning the document I will be traveling on Thursday
If we could wait until Monday delivery I could have drafts of both the agreement and exhibits
Read your notes re scheduling a call w/ or w/o GE
I had a very nice birthday weekend
Ric gave me pearls and peridots
I was wondering about that
I've put it on your calendar
I'm sure you will forward the place when you receive it
How long do you think it'll take
Kay can you join them late
I haven't seen Dan like that
I don't remember a PPA for Homestead
A while ago you sent me a copy of an FPL PPA for Homestead
Could you please resend me the document
It was a term sheet which was never executed as far as I know
I believe FPL prepared it and we may have commented on it
Let me see what I can find
Do we want to mention the cancellation provisions
Here's what you requested
Is there something I can help you with
Are you here
Just wanted you to know that I received your email and will follow through on the change order
I should be in the office on Thursday am if not sooner
As you can see I'm picking up email and can also be reached on my cell phone
I reviewed your email re VEPCO
It was good to get your input on VEPCO
I believe Chip Schneider is the RAC contact for this transaction
Well aren't you hangin' with the big dogs
Can you help me answer the following questions
I very much appreciate it
I know you know this but as a former trial type I just can't help myself
We aren't required to but I don't see a downside to sending it
Sent by Ben Jacoby@ECT I would think so
Please confer with Kay before we do
Should we send this to Mike Young
Sorry to miss your birthday
Did you have one in my honor
You know I really did have one for you on vacation
Points well taken - some we have already addressed others probably need to be tied up better
By the way it hailed in DC today
However Bill have given us some bad advice re Florida siting act
Also we do we stand on the negotiations concerning the letter of intent
I will send out a summary email later in the day
It will take me awhile to find it
Would you forward me the outside counsel list again
I have not received my password yet
Our records indicate that you have not selected reviewers
With your permission I will send it to Lee and Kent
Everything looks good to me
Go ahead and send it
If you have questions feel free to contact me
Monday I will be back in the office
If it looks acceptable I would be happy to send a copy to GE
Did Steve S ask that it be added to the list
I would let them bring it up if he didn't
I highlighted the changed terms
I expect that the Enron entity which will bid will be EPMI so I used that entity
I look forward to talking to you at your convenience
I'm back in DC at the Willard so I'm thinking of you
I hope things are ok for you
I know it is probably stressful
Kay Please mark your calendars
Tell him he is dropping to the B list
It was sent via fax to her
I like your letter
Otherwise all of your changes were fine.
I highlighted the changed terms.
I look forward to talking to you at your convenience.
Jim and his family have been in my prayers
I believe the plant manager was going to call someone at SW to keep the communication lines open
I am not sure what we decided on Friday
Yazoo has theirs in hand but I haven't heard any of any comments
Would you please handle this for me in the interim
If not please talk to Kay about who could handle this for Greg in my absence
I will review this but one of you needs to also
I thought on copied you on the email below
If not we can discuss tomorrow as I'm leaving shortly
I'll take a look at it today you night owl
Hope the kids cut you some slack after your late night
You're missing our last week of nice weather for the season
Hope you are enjoying your little ones
Either email or handwritten works for me
If the deal gets done sooner we can always have the new doc supercede the old one
Do you want hand-written or e-mail comments going forward
One point you were checking was the CA
I called pulled off track on a couple of things but I can get back to this now
Are you guys interested in having that conversation at this time
Any progress on drafting a letter of intent or are you still waiting on feedback from the team
I have also not touched the takeover provision
If Carlos has reviewed it I don't need to comment
Let me know if I can answer any questions
Anything I should tell him
Do you know if we had TECO sign a confidentiality agreement
I thought we were just sending out the public documents
I haven't gotten the executed docs back but I'll send you the electronic version if that works for you
Did you tell her yes yes yes
I'll do it now
I have a tolling arrangement to work on
Can someone point me in the right direction to find it
Could you call Charlotte ASAP and review the plan for tonight
Paige is in her car if you need her input
I believe Ben Jacoby has mentioned our deal with NorthWestern
We would like to get it wrapped up in the next two weeks if possible
Please let Ben or me know if you have any questions
Don't know who they will have on this one
I'm off to the Astros but would like to visit with you tomorrow if you will be around
I'm looking forward to working with you on this
I wonder who opposing inhouse counsel is at TECO
Chris is to send his redline to Greg David and you
David is to make his additions and then send a composite to Greg you and Chris
I'll send them a note to tell them you'll be there
The problem is they expressly do not have the power to have any say in the air permit process
However to facilitate coming into the city they expect something
It is very do-able we just need to structure it correctly
I'll copy my notes for you
THANK YOU for covering for me
Marlena doesn't speak it very well so ask for Walter
Marlena may get flustered and hang up on you
Here's what we sent them
I can understand how that can be a problem
I wouldn't use an LLC with an prior history
If the LLC paid for an interconnect study it could be a hard cost and we are dead
I know this seems silly but hey it is
She said to put the options in the terminal company not Lauderdale Land LLC as you had suggested
I don't have anything in particular in mind it is more of a theoretical question
How much is it and should this be the final amount
Don't know if this works but it is one thought
Let Fred and me know what works
Who at GE are you talking to
I was waiting but he did not bring it up
Probably saving it
Now all I have to do is fill in the blanks
I'm ready when you are
Could you email me the option agreement
Several people commented that they had problems reaching me and my phone was on almost the entire time
In fact I made many calls but I ususally checked to see if I had a signal first
I've skimmed it
Are we planning to renew it
Herman is out of the office today but I can discuss the fee issue to get his vote
How are we setting the heat rate
Is it a daily average weekly average
Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions
We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil right
How are we setting the bogey
I think I have the general idea but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check
Re stack model a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used
Are we clear that Cities buy gas MDEA buys/sells power
Would you please clarify the issue for me
David I would think I simple letter agreement should work
I can get it working from here
Talk to you soon I'm sure
I promised to send you the arbitration case we discussed
Did the CA get signed and sent and did it come back
Don't ask me to splain that because I can't
I can ask
Could we get this past the accountants
I haven't heard any differently
As such it is not a GE slowness LD
A valid concern-and perhaps we can pin GE for
I welcome your creative thoughts
I suspect this may be a TDI issue as well
It looks ok to me
I have a call in to him on another transaction so I'll ask
Are you in Houston today
Regardless I need to tell them something soon
Didn't really deal with her
Do we still want a master gas agreement for Clarksdale also
Do we want it now
We have discussed this with the customer and with our internal air permit guys
They have no run hour limitations on gas however they are limited on oil
Will look at it again
Should we have a definition
Do I have the latest draft of Marketing/Risk policies
I did a quick search and couldn't find it but I didn't do a page turn to locate it
I didn't see you on the distribution
I don't know how much good it will do you but at least it gives you some tax language
I'd like to see the installment sale form once it gets fixed up if possible
Chabot helped found the sanctuary foundation and sits on its board
Such pumping they say will degrade Elkhorn Slough
Did we try our best
Thanks again for your flexibility
They all have it now
I thought you would enjoy this one
Glad I gave you such a GLOWING review
I am printing the Fee Agreement right now
Kay I will bring for your initials in a few minutes
How depressing would it be to be at EECC
Did you ever hear about this matter
Could you outline what you think we should ask for or alternatively just draft it
I'll be happy to do so but can I please please beg off until nest week
Did I tell you that I spoke with GE about the assignment and their initial response was very positive
At least we will be ready
Ben's hoping it will fall through and he can sell these again I think
I don't think she finished her thought
If it is then what obligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a delivery point
The LOC will be mailed to you
Do you still require a Lien Waiver
Also do you want new invoices
Attached please find the documents that you requested
We can discuss next week at our conference
At least that's how I understand it
I left you a note about Michael possibly missing next week
Thanks for everything and see you next week
Glad you both made it
I give up
Did they actually change it
I don't understand the last sentence
Here's how I would do it
It seems to stop in mid sentence so I was wondering if maybe something got deleted
I believe Jeffrey may have mentioned this to you before
We would like to follow up with that now unless there is some significant problem with it
I've given it a quick look
Looks a lot different from when I last saw it
Maybe it isn't a problem
Also do you have a copyy of the site plan approval
Please call her with any comments you may have
His second kick nearly ripped the man's nose off his face
What happens if they don't pay their legal bills
Won't they have difficulty closing
We can pay their consulting fee up front
Maybe we can pay it into an escrow account
What is our concern
I believe my availability is good for Wednesday
I think Certosa Holdings is not paying its bills
But they did remove the last lien on the property
Herman blessed this letter but I think it needs to pass through your hands also
If you have your preamble stuff ready I'm happy to put it in now
I don't want to commit a blunder
I had a good one
Please call me with any questions or comments you may have
The Agreement as might be expected is very one-sided and is written primarily for their protection
I look forward to discussing this with you further
I will incorporate it into our form okay
I was looking at those online this weekend
I used play pens all of the time for my children
We went to Arlington for my nephew's high school graduation which was fine
Sunday we had dinner with Dan Lyons and spouse which was wonderful
Yesterday I cooked shopped and puttered in the yard
I like to wait until they are on sale
At least you can see their beautiful faces while they sleep
Yesterday I had a feeling that your grandbaby is a boy
Just came to me in the kitchen
The above the water is more stable than I expected
I had assumed that it would be tippy but it really wasn't
Hope you have high water and not hell next weekend
Apparently is was not a real big deal but I think it was her first ordeal of the kind
Re sleeping on backs I still don't understand that one
Did you do anything fun this weekend
Sounds good if you would like to forward to counter parties
Unless anyone else has changes would it be possible to send it out today
I need a Heather deal to work on
Should we look at Ancillary Services
Has it been cancelled
What are your schedules on Friday
Hope you both had good weekends
Ben Please see attached for your review and comments
They should let that be known don't you think
At least now WE know it
This place is more difficult than it needs to be
I hate not having information
I don't know if David Hunt will have comments
In any event Marvin Bob and the MDEA rep needs to reveiw it
Reagan has my current requests
Kay -- Do you know if David H is going to give you comments
If you haven't heard for sure one of us will call Marvin and find out/coordinate
I'm thinking my last email was unclear
Figured you did but better to be safe than sorry
Ben really wants me to check with you
I was out until today have you gotten what you needed
Anytime which works for you is fine as this is more important than my other meeting
It would help if you could connect the dots for me
Once the objection letter is in final form I will forward same to the optionor
Please put the TECO call on my and Fred's calendar
How's Glenn doing with my binder
I hear you are working on the Midway deal
I look forward to working with you on this one
I thought he was through with it last week
I'll check up on it
I inadvertently ended the sentence with a comma
Hopefully since we are only talking about a high pressure tap NCNG will have less leverage
Are you taking Friday off
So what do you think SUV or standard limo
I'm not sure what you mean about how to balance Michael
This party is for and about Paige and you too
I will be in charge of Michael Friday morning
I don't mind sitting second chair so to speak
If it were me I'd go for the standard limo mostly because I've never seen the other kind
Did he say what happened
I thought he wasn't taking her until next week
Neil just called and is taking his mom to the doctor
Let me know if you have any comments to the drafts
Apart from these consents we will need to coordinate to draft a joint instruction letter to Citibank
I would like a copy of the Pompano Beach and Deerfield Site Plan Approvals please
I just wanted some extra quiet time
How do I get on the list for the form
Could you pretty please check for me
This place amazes me
I have no patience for it
I can't wait for him to come home
I've got to take Roscoe for his last mange shot so I'm staying
Plus I spent last weekend with my folks and too much exposure doesn't work for us
I hope it is raining because that is great cleaning weather
I want to see bare space in my closet
I'll want to fed ex just in case you are sending anyone else's today
I can't believe you haven't gotten any kind of notice
I still need your credit card information for the phone bill
Yes because they are deducting pretax dollars for parking
But did you sign up for the transportation spending account
So where are you kayaking this weekend
I would mention Carlos in the email or have it shown as sent by him
Would you rather the question be sent by you
If so let me know and I will explain otherwise I will just copy you on the e-mail
Lake Woodlands do you want to come
Maybe it is on the development phone list
I don't have it at hand
Do you know Carlos' cell phone number
Will she give the baby her last name
Yes I know it looks like Kay but I thought it sounded cool
I'm still waiting on David Hunt to send me some stuff which would really help move the document along
There are still internal questions in it which I have annotated
I'm happy for you to look at it fairly shortly especially if you can give definitive commercial direction
I haven't worked on them but I suspect the exhibits need work
I know the bogey calc doc is a bit rough
Do you still owe me the emergency transmission cut stuff
Early next week is better than later and Thursday and Friday are huge problem days for me
When are you thinking of meeting with Beck
I should have cc'd you two on this also
It should be signed and on its way
Kay I have O.K.ed the extension letter and advised Marvin of my approval
He will get it authorized by the Commission
That reminds me
I don't remember where it is - PR
I wonder who would know
It makes me excited just to think about it
I can't locate the electronic version of Costs that David prepared
Can you resend it to me
Kay lets couch it as below...or similar...what I did below is botchy
If there are any other resolutions etc that they want I would let them prepare them
You're killing me
I'm in the office today if you want to finish up ABB
Kay I called Cingular to see what was up with your bill
So you are not set up currently for your credit card to be charged
I need to ask her for a flat screen monitor
Ok sending it in now
Have you officially been changed to Elizabeth's cost center
I just like to make Margie work
So do you think they'll fire Dierker
I have a template but I'll go ahead and let them take the lead
She is very excited about her new assistant
I see that
She hasn't gotten to Carol's yet and I did it a few days ago
I like both systems but then I'm very adaptable
Did you give me an ok review
Here's where I am
I haven't finished all of your changes
Please look for bold stuff that's where I have questions
If no question is given I'm looking for your confirmation
There are still holes but hopefully it sets out the basic commercial deal
Please note that we are anticipating a Monday meeting
Therefore we have sent this out without the usual internal review
I'll bet they didn't check his references
Have I signed this yet
As a result will you overnight the sig pages and the incumbency certificate to Tremaine Wright
From an accounting / finance perspective I am interested in how we should proceed given the circumstances
In the meantime I will forward turbine contracts to everyone as soon as I receive them
As for officers of the development company I would use Dave Duran
Hope you get email
Gregg and I need to review it
How in the world did you jump to that crazy conclusion
Oh I know she is excited about her new assistant
Does this mean you gave me a bad review
I think Ben's time frame is realistic
I assume we will enter into an assignment and assumption agreement with Sithe to which GE will consent
In addition we may need an override letter to the turbine contract to address the E-Next/accounting issues
GE is familiar with what we need in for E-Next which should help expedite matters
Let me know if either is possible
I'd let Marissa mess with sending it out
Bet you are jealous
I am sure you have been looking forward to getting all these documents so here they are
To my knowledge the only outstanding report is the DPR
It was intended to show the format but they inadvertently pulled numbers into it
I will drop Mr Derrick a voice mail but I would faint if he objected
Please let me know if you are available today to discuss this transaction with Sr Jacoby and me
Additionally it would be helpful to discuss the tolling arrangement with Ken
I haven't heard anything from David or Scott
Have you heard anything from Marvin or Bob
I would like to have a flat screen monitor if possible
What can you think of in walking distance
It is a lunch for a new lawyer in our group
The only thing they had at noon today was in smoking
Let me know if you want it changed
Let's talk about these comments at your earliest convenience
I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re exclusivity
Seems a little silly in this case but it can't hurt
I'm not asking him to do anything on the LOI
I haven't spoken to him in person
I'll address it when we connect
Are you available this afternoon to talk to him with me
Have we asked John to turn this around by Monday
I will review your comments on the LOI
Are you still OK with that
How firm are we on the Midway project
Can we assume this will also cover Ft Pierce
Here is the information on the charity golf outing we discussed
Thanks for your support in this good cause
Can I get some other tentative commitments
I have left the pricing blank for now subject to a refresh from structuring
Do you know if we are meeting on Monday
I haven't heard the final word
Can you handle this for me
I'll work on them over the weekend
I haven't heard a word about this deal lately
This is why I never throw anything away
Please review it and we need to discuss further
I hear Oz will be there too
I vote for you
Do you want to send the LOI to TECO or should I
Let me know what your schedule looks like today
I believe so
Whew those took a really long time didn't they
In fact I could use some help with the EEI if the offer is still good
Maybe you could just talk me through it
We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday and I could really use your help
I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter
Also do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week
Seems like you need a sig
I go back for more tests this afternoon
I know Citibank does not require a corporate seal
Kathleen is out sick so it will be a day or two
Can the call go on without her
I can't make the call on Thursday
Next time you vote for me please copy me on the email
I haven't read this yet so it is not ready to be sent to TECO
Just wanted to give you a look as soon as possible
Sometimes John forgets that he is not a lawyer
I'm available for one hour so long as I can call in from off campus
However in my absence this week,I would appreciate it if you would coordinate any requests for assistance through Clark
I'll look forward to catching up with you next Monday
Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think we've done that on the other two deals
For something that doesn't matter it seems to matter
Are they squirming yet
I still hold the originals in my hands pending your instructions
I would appreciate hearing back from you at your earliest convenience
I have other counsel engaged for the sale but this falls into a different category
Have we engaged outside counsel to review this agreement
I suppose that after I review it next stop is Finance/Accounting
Carlos has given me a couple of comments
Kay As you requested attached are our copies on the draft of the EPMI Agreement
It is Father's Day and we will do what you want
If you want to go there that's great
I'm calling them and Red Oak this morning
I will have GR do the back yard also
Would it be easier to work with reps/warranties
What is your availability this afternoon
Both Rod and I are available
Yes,which is what prompted my email this am
I have attached those riders so you can advise me
I should have sent this to you
Might save time if you got financials from Mike re NorthWestern Corp
Amazing that they stayed afloat
I liked those guys
On the tolling term sheet I agree with Fred's comments
My conversations will be regularly interrupted by golf strokes but I will do my best to be available
Call me if you have specific questions/issues to discuss
Did you find the box in your office
I give you details later
Are you going to this
Sheila is being held hostage and the guys know that but they want to have the call anyway
No he thinks he is God's gift to contracts
I told them you are on vacation but they still want to have the call
I will call you tomorrow before I drop by your office
Neil I thought you were going to tell her to just answer that he gets nothing at school
Thanks for you help with this
Michael looked so happy to see you for chapel today
I have a few questions in order to complete this form
If you could answer them for me I can have this turned in tomorrow
Once again I have really enjoyed getting to know your family
Sounds like it but it is in southern Florida
We will be getting with each of you regarding presentational material etc
I didn't think you were being difficult
Could you draft a letter to that effect for my review
When can we expect their feedback
Will you accept the changes and send out
I would like to receive a bcc of whatever goes out if possible
Could you give me a brief outline of their scope
He probably does other things as well but that's how I know him
I can send it to Lloyd if you want
I do not know Lloyd
I'll try to reach you this afternoon to discuss
I want to update my electronic file
So is it about time to get Lisa Herman and Rose involved in the PAD stuff
I stayed two other places I didn't like but the names escape me
What do you guys know about the Mayflower
Don't know how I missed this
Must have put it in my Midway file without looking
I've answered all their questions and have suggested to Chris that he ask NorthWestern for audited financials
Probably be a good idea for you to sign the letter
I don't think they will trade payment for a consent but I could be wrong
If so I will have accounting request the funds
When you ask a question you usually have heard a rumor
What did you hear
We are paying for this so we don't want to spend a fortune
You know I do make sure his bills get paid
I just don't think that's right
Have you guys had any new additions to your group
Jeff I don't know if you have seen this so I thought I would float it by you
Why would you ask a question out of the blue
Now would I ask a question if I already knew the answer
I think asking David the question is a good idea
If all we were doing was buying the property you wouldn't have the timing restriction
I don't remember anyone signing a notice of lien in Arizona
I always thought that was strange and sure created clutter
I can't remember if there was any requirement that we sign
I guess they could have changed the laws though
Very disruptive of my self-perception
I'll buy you a drink as payment in kind
I remember this from our previous work out there
There is no dispute but he is sending the notice anyway
I understand all of that
It doesn't exactly read like I am required to acknowledge receipt
What do you think or remember
Am I required to sign the notice or not
Minor point I know but I'd rather not raise the flag in Birmingham
A copy is being delivered to you today
You are welcome to participate if you would like
Could you email me that name and number
I took Roscoe in to get neutered
Neil just couldn't handle it
I hope the weather gets better for this evening
You know I've kept all my files on email
Otherwise I guess I'm going to have to ask you to start printing - highly inefficient
I can't do it here though
If you would like to call me we can conference in David
Sorry to ask but when do you expect to have a draft of the GE letter
I need to manage Ben's expectations
Could you PLEASE PLEASE call David Marshall and get his email
I KNOW it's not a vacation day my dear
I need a drink
It's been one busy day for me too
Jacoby's assistant just called and wanted your home address
Of course if it was great news then it could be a celebratory drink
I told Ric I may come by for a drink but I didn't know yet
I think I'll call and get exact directions
At the very least the cancellation charges are theirs
I'm not sure of her taste
It'll be interesting to see what they send you
Besides Delmis may be able to bring our clothes in on Tuesdays and I'm generally home early on Friday
He will leave us a sack today
I assume these are in your VEPCO files
If not I'll do it the old fashion way the Word way
Oh I found them
No sense making it more difficult than it is
Then again this might not be difficult for you
Did you get your locks cut
Are you kidding free food and booze
I have been looking in to this option since you Erik and I discussed this possibility
Sorry I missed you when you returned by call this am
I have some concerns about the voice mail you left re assignment language
Can you give me a guesstimate
Hope I didn't think it was trash and delete it
Who sent it
I have no access to that information
I hope I can find mine when I need it
When do you leave next week
Do I have original initialled documents to which I can add the signature pages
I have no idea what happened with the redline but I'll try to get a decent one done
What can I say
Hope all is well with your bunch
Give Lou a howdy and a hug for me
Please Federal Express all six originals to me also
Scary how true it seems
In Houston we drink Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper
Could you please forward it to them for me
I am tied up most of Thursday afternoon but am generally available the rest of the week
Will you be in Friday
If so could you help me remember to pick up my parking card
I FINALLY got a slot at the Met
You will be able to get out of your current garage
I'll let you know what else I find out
Per Gregg's request I am forwarding ABB's wiring instructions
Could we push back the conference call to the afternoon
That is so kind of them considering the last minute notice
It's probably easier to do them all at one time anyway
Are you coming into the office on Friday
Will you get your tickets before you leave this afternoon
I guess you don't need them though
I went out to lunch and it's so hot outside
Of course it's running right through me
Let me see what's up
I'll see what we can figure out
Have you left yet
If you cannot make it please let me know sometime during the day
Allyson and others calling in I will have a call-in number by noon
Just spoke with Bill Sherk and he confirmed almost verbatim Steve Raper's report
Rob Shaw NCNG is checking with their operations to determine whether NCNG can provide the necessary pressure
I'm glad to discuss this if I can be of help
Could you please accommodate Karen's request
If you would like you can just send it to me and I will get it to her

If so I can get him to send
I suspect he wants to review it before it is signed and he's on vacation this week
Attached for your review and signature is Change Order No
I believe Ben needs to initial the change order and he's on vacation this week
Please send one to my attention
What's my R/C number

Please forward the revisions once you get them

The executed signature page has been faxed per your instructions
I'm going to miss you really badly
Are you sure you want to go to the cool air unwind sip wine and eat delicious food
I believe this task is complete
I shouldn't have looked at that when I'm so hungry
Plus I bet it is nice there when the sun goes down
Can you hear my heavy sighs
It is time for me to plan something fun even a short trip
I have an extra I can send you today
Do you have a copy of the signed Transformers Purchase contract
Thursday afternoon would be best for me
That time's no good for me - Westinghouse meeting
I enjoy being back downtown after being a suburban lawyer
Home life is relatively calm which has always been a goal of mine
I'm dealing with my folks getting older with the health problems which come with that process
If you are spending time at HM you must still be doing the law thing
I might have lost a bet on that one
So how's your life
Paige completed her minor in German
Consider it a Wunder legacy
You would get a huge kick out of him
I can't wait to hear what is going on with you
I saw Peggy and we spoke about you
I just wanted to know how you and Paige were doing
If not when will it be delivered
That way we can sign this up next week
Could we benefit from an internal meeting prior to the call
Did you want to send this
Anything else you want to add
I think she may leave tomorrow
Have you ever visited her website
I suspect she will have the same mailing address as well since it is a box number
He takes his dinosaur everywhere
She should be off of most of her restrictions tomorrow so maybe he will get to see her more
We went to the Astros game last night and they actually won
The pitcher said he watched it just because he had never seen such an awesome hit
Too bad about the heat but what the heck can you do about it anyway
Or you can search Paige Record Southwestern University on the web and find it
How do I get Paige's web site to come up
Some of you may have received this already
I have not compared it against what we last sent them
Sheila said her assistant arranged for one
Could you check
Thanks for thinking of it
Hi my name is Kay and I'm a Diet Coke addict
Don't you drink Diet Coke
It would be very helpful if you could participate or have your designee participate
Perhaps we can also arrange a discussion about the interconnection agreement
PS I can't wait to hear about St Lucia
John Normand/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT wants you to attend a meeting
Is Friday better for you guys
All we need is the Consolidation Agreement
Do you have any interest in sitting in
What did Heather tell you
I have a heavy meeting/conference call schedule
To be honest with you I'm a bit unclear on who is doing what with this
I didn't check to see what it was before
I've changed it on your calendar
I suppose it's in the same room
Suggest you call him to confirm
I know they are in the Allen Center
Where do you see that room
I saw no room information yet
Hey what happened to those docs that you said had to be fed exd to Legner
Just thought I'd let you know
I really struck out with everyone else for Friday
Would you like to join me
I've asked Heather and Jeffrey Keenan to join me
I hope to go at least Friday/Saturday assuming we have a sitter for Michael of course
I met Mrs Kerekgarto yesterday
Or maybe you can visit more than one class
I will not send anything to Rose Mary yet
Herman you will be happy to know that this one is much shorter
Our son Michael is in a Montessori kindergarten which we have decided may not be most suitable for him
We discussed it with Vivian Shudde and she suggested that I give you a call about the Grace School
My husband and I would like to visit Grace
We are wondering if it might be possible to visit tomorrow
I need to know where we left this document
Is this the SOTW report you requested
I will call a leave a message as well
Hope to meet you tomorrow
He's here with me
Early in the week is better for me
I have received material from Reagan in response to Question No
Reagan do you have problems providing the total project cost under seal
We can file as is but I expect the public Staff will want to follow up
Also we do have the cost data and are filing that under seal
Jeff Smith PS Kay Mann said she would close up the Consolidation Agreement discussions with you too
Brian Here are my comments on several items
Otherwise I suggest deleting it
Hope you and Neil have fun at the party
I guess Paige is at school
In the meantime perhaps you would like for us to go ahead and mail an admissions packet to you
If so please give me your address and it will go out in today's mail
Do we have a CA with Teska Associates
In fact I work with reformed engineers daily in various capacities
I know construction/equipment obligations are problems studies generally ok
This leads me to the conclusion that a geotechnical survey would be ok Am I safe here
At some point he will need to be involved
The time is fine with me
This should do it
Will you be the ENA Tax Man on the deal
When you are finished please complete the spreadsheet for all of our records
I have not included any ENA burdens or storage cost
Hope this helps you with the WLB bucket
I usually stay away from spam but I thought this was nice
Please delete Stuart Zisman and add me to your distribution list
If she thinks of anything else she will let me know
In other words it will be crowded
My understanding is that we have already bought/sold natural gas in Oklahoma Texas and Louisianna
Please let me know what you think we should do
Northern Illinois Gas Co did agree to these provision in the contract with its Hub Agent
Peoples however is not free to change the GTC as it sees fit
I will review this further
This seems necessary to me
I like this answer
If that changes in the future I will let you know
Please let me know who should be added to this list
I suggest you put our outside counsel last on the list
I would put Bracewell before Kilpatrick
Call/see me to discuss any of this information
Isn't it nice to know he is looking out for you
You can tell how much he cares about you
I really enjoy each one of them
I think that this meeting should be held without lawyers
I did not change the effective date
I don't see youor name listed on their distribution list
I sent comments in a separate e-mail
I'm far afield of my area of expertise but Boyd's comments make a great deal of sense to me
Gregg did you/will you pass these along to PERC
Perhaps it would help if Boyd could speak directly to the PERC person with the typewriter so to speak
I don't see why there is a need to reference PERC
Thank you for your work
I especially appreciate the memo bringing me up-to-speed
Did I get that right
Here are my vitals
Basically I want to make sure I'm on the right track
I'll make it look pretty as we go along
Kay I left you a voice mail yesterday at Sheila's suggestion regarding Midwest
Please call me so that I can comply with Greg's request.
Greg I will have the boilerplate sent to you separately
Here is the email you mentioned
I'm no expert at CompareRite but I believe it worked
Let me know if you have any trouble opening this document
Maybe spelling your name right will help this go through
I didn't prepare the other option but I'll check to see if there is a copy around
As always - thanks for your help
We can amend the LLC Agreement if necessary but it seems burdensome since the title is only a formality
Section VII Majority of the wording came initially from attorneys I would recommend confirming that
Response I will run this by the attorneys
I will ask the attorneys if we need to limit Section VIII Who is the General Manager of MEH
Vlady - As we discussed I am attaching my revisions to your initial draft
Let me know if you have any concerns about my edits
What do you think about that approach
I'll catch up on what I missed later
On today's call we also talked about meeting in person tentatively the last week of Sept place TBD
I will chase down the fax and give it a look
Can't WAIT to hear about your trip
I hope it was marvelous
I think it is time for a change
I need to talk to the commercial guy on the deal
Got a name for me
Sorry we couldn't help
Since the time frame is short I wanted to give you an outline to mark up/correct
We have presented to People's a nonphysical method to monetize it similar to what was done with Bammel
Can't wait to see what you get
I won't say where I got it
Let me know if you need anything further to proceed immediately
I'll find you
I'm looking at it
We are going to amend our petition for the CPCN and I want to get the name right
I am also a notary
If you have any ideas on these points please let me know
Do you have anything else especially one more current
Can you shed any light on its status
I never got the email
Please send it again
It isn't quite done but I wanted to let you have a look at it ASAP
I am absolutely delighted
I expect that it will take about an hour
We are primarily discussing issues regarding our amendments to the application
Specifically we want to confirm an amendment regarding the layout of the plant
Second we want to confirm the LLC and its appropriate papers
If you have any questions
If you find it acceptable it should be ready to go to Peoples as a draft
Just checking to make sure you got this email
Have you sent a reply and I have missed it
Please let me know if you have trouble opening it
Incidentally I have had the pleasure of working with you in the past
I have alerted Dan Shultz Brian Barto and Dwight Alexander of these events
Please summarize for us the status of inspections shipments of the order
Gregg Penman was ready but I couldn't get David Tucker at Bracewell
Did he forget
I drank it without food as it was nice and light which is how I like my reds
It would have been good with a tomato based pasta I think
How do I find out how much vacation I have
I know there's a system on the intranet
I want to plan some time off this year if possible
I know how difficult it can get the longer I wait
Thursday I won't be in until around noon
Sheila when do you want to reschedule this call
I need to bring you up-to-speed on where we are and share some comments from Virginia Power
Please let me know a good time to visit
In the future we will have our seven ports
Would you mind getting me a Diet Coke
I have the money in here but I can't leave my desk
I should have thought ahead
I don't have the MEH Operating Agreement
Do you have an electronic copy of it
Is he availabe tomorrow
Is he key or should we try for tomorrow
I didn't know how urgent the meeting was
I'll let you know what I hear from Barto
That's it just HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Hope no one is picking on you too badly today
Time permitting we can discuss the ESA transaction once we are done with the GE stuff
In the meantime we are awaiting Mike's mark-up
Would you let him know
Thanks a lot for all your help
We could try to lessen our exposure as much as possible with the lease and get indemnity from PGL
Call me to discuss these issues
Tuesday is bad for me but Wednesday or Thursday looks good
If anyone asks I would prefer to have Gloria for our temp
Brenda would you please get a temp for my desk for that entire week
Please review and send me your comments
Did you receive a password for yours
Becky could you run a time off report so Kay can see how much vacation time she has left
I don't believe I can do that for her
You can just send it to me or whatever is easier
I wasn't sure if you got a copy of this
Once you are all together just call me
If another approach is preferred we will need to circle back with Lisa
As far as I know this concept hasn't been addressed with GE
I re-calculated the overhead charge so you might want to check it out
I'm reading it now
I look forward to hearing from you at your convenience
Virginia Power - don't know how hot it is
I would like to visit there next week
As you know the Manlove monetization is still on the list
I can give you whatever details you need
I will try to take this one it
By the way have you been invited to the ENA law conference at the Woodlands
We need to get you in on that one
By the way do you know if Kathleen has been included in the law conference stuff
Tuesday is good should something change for you
Kay I will be in Houston on Monday through Wednesday afternoon but will be busy most of Tuesday
How is your late Monday afternoon looking
Here's what I know about this deal so far
Thank you for this info
I have your name written on a piece of paper
Do I owe you a call
You didn't know there were so many options did you
I'll catch you up later
Is this still ok with you
Indemnity issues They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors
Please let me know if you have any question
I will call Len Green today to find out
Wild isn't it
I don't know my travel plans yet
If not I will be leaving tomorrow
I don't need you to make any arrangements yet
I thought you might ask me that
I tend to think NCNG would not ask
Actually I appreciate the info
Do we want to address the purchaser's parent guaranty in both of the contracts or just the consolidation agreement
I will be on the road tomorrow but will check my voice mail
More names are being added so feel free to suggest more that we forgot/overlooked including those external to Enron
Lisa Mitch and Chris you will be on the next draft
This is the VEPCO contact list as far as I know
Do we have another one
I'll fill you in on the details when I have them
I'll let you know the details when I have them
I'm either losing my mind or my email
Did you send me an email re GE
I thought I saw one but now I can't find it
Is that a trick and if so how do I do it
Could you resend it please
Here's the notice we discussed
Would you like a copy
Where should I stay in Chicago
That's all I know for now
At least your email helped me get back to reality
I apologize for the confusion for not getting back to you etc
One of them is essential to the call
Please leave me a voice mail of the outcome
I left both of them voicemails
Just wondering if I should cancel
I need direction here please
Do I have seat assignments on the last two legs
I look forward to seeing you on Thursday and breathing some cooler air for a change
I will also be checking my voicemail but will not be picking up email
How ironic considering how busy we were this time last year
I don't think I've been fishing since July
Geez it is half way through September
I hear the Aquarium closed - killed by bike lanes
I sent an e-mail
I will dredge up and resend
Let's discuss at your earliest convenience
I haven't seen it
If not should we call him together
Da Bulls toner is low so the draft doesn't look good and I don't know where the others print
Let me clarify
The Roll-in is my next vote on the dive tour
I'm ready to start working on it from ENA's standpoint
Remind me if I forget
Jeff said that you would have a copy
Is our site behind the Rocky Mount gate
Hoyle referred us to Deck McCain senior planner for the city
Once annexation happens we go through the city's process
He put his submittal preparation on hold as a result
Discuss our timing for option transfer
We have not evaluated or discussed with them further
What else does the legal framework offer and can we negotiate a position we like
To finalize the permit we need to get a letter from the city the county or both
Send it all in
I've been taking notes along the way but I will be asking you for your thoughts here shortly
I would vote for the Roll-in
I would buy just to see Keffer there
I know the procedures weren't followed
I have forwarded to corporate secretary's office for filing
What do you want to do this weekend
Should I thaw sausage for tonight
Sweetie Since you went in late today would it help you if I picked up Michael
It would not be a problem for me
Kay That will work fine for me
Hope it isn't too bad
Also Thursday is my mom's birthday so I need to remember to shop for her at lunch tomorrow
If so please advise of any time you have available on Monday and I'll get it set up
I don't think the weather could have been better
Does that work for us from a timing pointof view
I know how you like to work weekends
Also too and more important are you up from drinks this evening
I'll let you know what we get
God forbid I should take the stairs
I'll let you know what he comes up with if anything
I haven't opened the attachment yet but I wanted to get it to you asap
I added the clause on the Parent Guarantee and without thinking made it a GE obligation
I checked the paper for an obit about Don
How was his mother
Are you going to Jillian's on Thursday
He's doing pretty good trying to take it a day at a time
I worked on notecards all weekend
You'll have to introduce her
Who will she be working with
I think you'll like her
Long conference calls make me happy about having email
Do you want Brian/Lisa/anyone else commercial
Could you get our guys assembled
Please let me know how this works for you
I should have included you also
I inadvertently left you off the list
I haven't heard from anyone yet
Also can you find a conference room
I suppose a location would help
Location TBD I'll make sure you get a call
I will be there if you tell me where
This is the most current information I have on specifications
I can come
I'm looking at it right now
Could you please email it to me
It is my understanding that it will not
I'm glad we are going in October to Las Vegas
I know you can silly
I left VMs for Scott and Brian along with the emails
It's meeting city today between you and Dan
She's very nice to me but she does like to keep very specific hours
She told you she'd be there but she didn't know where to go
I only do OT for my people and I can't believe she doesn't have a better work ethic
I don't run across many people without email these days
Is there a more up-to-date version and if so could you please mail it to me
This makes me crazy
I feel better
I just don't think we owe them enough yet
At least that's how I understood it
I agree with Rusty re the put option complicating things for us
Also how can we be bound to a deal when the agreement has expired
Fred Refresh my memory on who I need to go to for the option payment check
Due to a last minute conflict we need to reschedule this meeting
Otherwise I will have to go to Accounting twice
As soon as I get a redline I'll get it to Accounting and we can go forward quickly
I just had a meeting cancel for tomorrow which will help
I have suggested that we propose one year
This is why we are in a hurry
I know you're getting pulled in a lot of directions and I appreciate the help
Ozzie had to leave town and he wanted to participate in the first meeting
I'm sure we will get something worked out
Kay--as indicated in my voicemail I will definitely be out of pocket on Wednesday
Is the petition itself public
Once again your assistance is appreciated
I hate to admit this but I need another copy of whatever confidentiality agreement we have with Virginia Power
This may be our best bet
The Application itself is public
Also the engineering plan we filed recently in response to a data request was confidential
Additionally it looks like we have the testimony and application filed with the Public Staff to work with
Did someone send you copies of equipment contracts
Therefore please advise what you received from Enron in that regard
I don't recall the specifics at this point
I don't know what I have in mind
I haven't heard from St Francis yet
I would think so
I haven't followed up with after school care there
I don't have the information they sent
I'm sending it for Enron review only since I haven't even read the entire thing yet
I would like to see what's the latest in that regard
Don't need a consolidation agreement so we don't have to negotiate one
Is there any reason we can't go with a single contract
I have a call in to Rob Stevens to verify in Stan's absence
Would you please call Mitcha and get the relevant information
Enron will finish deploying its domestic telecommunications network by the end of this year Lay said
I'll let you know when I get it
FYI I want to see if we are in compliance with the confidentiality provisions of those contracts
Do you have a copy of the entire thing
Maybe we can track down the rest
Do you think someone in your group might have that
I do not have the entire contract
I think it would be a good idea
Do you want me to request an entire copy from him
I will holler as soon as John S releases his doc
I knew you were thinking about it so I didn't worry
I'm monkeying around the PPA only because I had a meeting with Ozzie and Heather late last night
I can forward you what I've done for your review
I forgot to reply to this
Just let me know when you want to discuss it
I don't think I saw that happen
I don't recall being any worse than anyone else
Carlos does not believe me
This is helpful to know and we all need to discuss
Since you said you were going to call Sammy Kirby anyway I didn't call back
We had a meeting today to try to finalize our testimony
We plan to let you see it before we file it
We currently have two alternative recommendations in our testimony
In the application you say Enron has an option on the land
I hope that is clear
For the first one we need a signed contract before the order goes out at the VERY latest
It would be nice to have it before the hearing.
I'm at home this am trying to get it finished up
I will make sure that the dates work
Please tell me if you approve of this form of LOC
I am also sending this form to Robin Veariel
I called in for the Finance meeting
I should be in after lunch
Now you know why I'm at home
I just checked my messages
How close did I get
Gary didn't seem to like it
Maybe we give it a couple of hours
I'm getting nervous but I tell myself that whatever works out will be for the best
I'm working as fast as I can
Things connect together so it takes a little while
I think I'm about done with the hard stuff
Don't mean to put pressure on you
Came by my office on the way to another meeting
I should be done soon
I'm losing it
I'm going over it right now
I believe we file a Cert of Correction
I will proceed expeditously and let you know when complete
Can you take care of getting this changed officially
Also we have told the State that the name is Edgecombe
I spoke with Bob Henson
I think I'd still rather be a woman although now I can't remember why I feel that way
I think the LLC agreement would be a big help
The certified Certificate of Correction will be attached to it
I asked this exact question this afternoon
I am running out the door
Leave me any instructions re additional needs/questions/problems
Yes and please add me too
I can't remember if I mentioned that before
Probably safe to assume it is me
This means we won't be in town for the Compaq thing
They usually do everything first class all the way since it is the officers shindig
I will put this on our calendars
Too bad you won't make the Compaq thing but maybe next year
Do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer or should this be more generic
Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract or several
If anyone has it handy it could speed things up for me
I see we expect to have separate contracts for each project
Hence I think that we have to reference the manufacturer
I expect at least one EPC contract per project
I didn't send it to Jeff since he is out today
Please give me a call when you can
I think you and I may have different documents
Maybe we should compare
If you can't attend please see me as soon as possible
It's how you get somewhere on Wall Street
I would like for us to discuss this as well
This is a comparison to their version
I think I have a comparison to ours as well
A comparison to ours
I think you sent me an email which had some information from the gang about the tests etc
I was out of the office on Friday so I just now heard your voice mail
I'll give the forms a look and fax them your way with some type of disclaimer for Peoples benefit
I have to consult with local counsel re groundwater issues
Can you evaluate/recommend either
Additionally we recommend the insertion of the language in blue
PS Barbara is also notifying her Legal contact of this change
Sounds like fun to me
Michael will love it
By the way I picked up a Paper City just to read about you
I feel like I know someone famous
Bart just asked for your phone number which I gave him of course
I know Michael would love it
Per our conversation attached is the requested Punchlist
I would like to chase down that issue some more before a loud alarm is sounded however
This is an internal draft which has not been sent to CRRA as far as I know
Here's a first ckm draft based on what we had before
I based this on a very brief discussion I had with Heather so I hope I didn't misunderstand
This is the one you looked at and left me comments
When we get together to discuss stuff maybe we can review this
It is difficult to get your comments over voice mail as I'm just not that quick
Kay and Rusty Attached is the redlined Titan-Ledford Option for your review
Please review and discuss any comments with me or Mark Gershon
Matt Since so much of this related to tax I thought you should have a look at it
Copies are provided in Word Perfect and Word for your convenience
As such we have had to go out and find a GSU
The good news is we have found one through GE
Please contact me on Tuesday to discuss whatever is necessary
One more thing I want to mention
I will follow up to get the details of the discussion
You made me laugh
Here's the latest info I have
I spoke with him today in regarding the reasons for cancellation
Further investigation on his part uncovered some internal VEPCO issues
He understands that this is his challenge not ours
However we have the ability to partially terminate if we see fit
I thought it was an excellent synopsis
I can call you when I get out of my meeting but it might be awhile
I will leave you a vm as to the outcome
Sushi sounds good to me
I haven't heard from Carrie Burton
Is it a full moon
I was hoping that it would be ready so I could pick it up a lunch but it wasn't
Thank you so much for your efforts to get this scheduled
However it doesn't look today is going to work
Since spoke earlier this week Michael has been accepted to private school where we believe we will move him
Is it possible to schedule a meeting with that in mind
If not we can schedule the meeting next week
FYI and for us to discuss
I look forward to working with you on this transaction
I faxed it to David originals being sent to you
I trust you will find it in order and would appreciate a confirmation at your earliest convenience
We couldn't decide what it means so it needs to be re-written or deleted
The party we are contracting with is Virginia Power not NC Power
If we misstated this previously we would like to clear it up now
I hope we will get to meet in person soon
I picked up the package of information today and will read it tonight
I haven't seen the paperwork on the name change
I asked around yesterday and I have someone checking it out
I believe I sent you a form services agreement to review
I will resend the email for your easy reference
That's it for this moment
Don't have the answers to your questions but I wanted you to see the attachment to Gregg's email
So do we now have an Enovate/enovate
Maybe it is covered by the EPC= wrap
I assume the onshore contract has some of the same issues
I had the definite impression he was going to call you
He is older than Ned so he didn't go to school with him
I haven't heard from Barton-have you
If anyone has any other thoughts please let me know
Any thoughts please let me know
I will check with Herman again to get his final comments
I spoke with Karen Way this afternoon
Please call/email myself and Karen with any comments
I'm headed to a lengthy conference call but I wanted you to have this info
I don't think it will take long to get a draft
Is it Mary Lynn that I should talk to
I have not dropped it off yet
Can he be set up for Monday
I just left you a vm
Instead to give it to the school
Did you drop off the contract and other stuff this morning
She will get back to us on the latter
Write when you can
How could I resist such an opportunity
Not to say that it will but it might
I thought Tom wanted to change the time
Did he get with you on that
If not can you point me in the right direction
I know you don't have anything better to do but I really appreciate it
Is it on its way or perhaps been misdirected
I look forward to discussing this with you soon
At least that gives us something to work with
Are we good to go
I forgot to show my husband your pictures
If it is ok with you I'll bring them back on Monday
Jeff I'll be glad to hold you numbers in trust as well
Please call me with any comments
What did I miss
Stuart has finished his review of the PR invoices and not the massive pile is on my desk
If the meeting room or schedule changes let me know before Thursday
Scott has given me some comments on the LOI which I hope to discuss and incorporate today
I made changes in accordance with our meeting on Friday
Is he an authorized signatory under the agency agreement
Please let me know if you need anything additional
If you have any issues / changes / questions let me know
I suggest the changes as shown on the attached
Let me know if you think the edits are sufficient
I thought someone from Trading should give this a look
As you are all aware Peoples' Board meets this Wednesday to approve the risk management policy
I would like to have any comments ASAP but no later than first thing tomorrow morning
If this doesn't work please let me know
Here is the ABB contract you referenced in your email
We can talk about it later if you want
Is it ready to go to GE
Is it an Enron company
Thank you Fred
I would think cocktail attire
What would you think
Thank you for calling last night
We took Michael out for dinner to celebrate his first day at SF and missed your call
All the kids drew portraits of him and he got a big kick out of it
Tough time of day to dress for but I think you have it figured out
I may do a little shopping
What are you going to wear
Do you have lots of formal attire
Here's a revised draft for your review and comment
So now it is just a warranty
I've also been more explicit about our fee
Sorry didn't mean to forget you
I knew you guys would hit a home run
As I am sure you have heard the hearing went famously
They had not discussed the language you submitted last week
Your language is where they will start
I will be out of the office Wednesday and Thursday
Please talk with Jeffrey if you have any questions
Has anyone found it
If not we need to get a copy from GE
Warning I have not even opened this to see how it looks
I'm thinking that this is Dale's project so I'm sending him a copy
Per your request attached is a copy of the final MEH Operating Agreement

I had already looked at the weather
You haven't been there with Enron have you
I can bring Michael with me if necessary
I don't know if it is meant to make us feel better or it just IS better
Michael would probably be more comfortable in his own home
I checked the weather and it looks like we picked the right weekend to go to Palacios last weekend
You were right it does warm my heart
It certainly appears God is trying to show us we made the right decision don't you think
Are you going to be around for the long weekend

What is the Blue Ridge Power Agency as in what type of legal entity is it
It sounds like it isn't one if we would be signing CA's with each member
Sounds like we may need CA's for each one of them
Rahil it would be very helpful if you could give us a bit more lead time next time around
We want to do the best job possible for you
As discussed here're the details surrounding our deal discussions with Blue Ridge Power Agency
Following our meeting with Blue Ridge they have sent us some load data and have chatted with us re
I will be tied up until late today
My brother just called and my dad has just been admitted to the hospital for a heart problem
If they do then I will need to go to Ft Worth for a couple of days
Have we given them anything in writing yet and are you willing to mark everything
Then I'm just fine with it
Ideally we'd like to have that covered but don't think it is critical if the information there is not
Going forward I believe our revised proposal already has the stamp on every page
If not we will ensure that it is marked
Are you guys okay with everything else
Ok I've changed your expenses account and am into your calendar etc
Do you just use your cell phone now

Just wanted to let you know I'm thinking about you
Wishing you the best
Please keep in touch and let me know how you're doing
I know there are some other issues but getting these documents will really help
If I'm remembering correctly it could be Connecticut
That narrows it down quite a bit
As mentioned I have not seen an executed copy and there may not be one
Here's what I got from Eric on the lease
The numbers don't seem to match but we won't worry about that now
To the extent necessary just bracket any questions you have especially commercial questions

I wouldn't want to bother her about anything
I'm sure she had things put together well
Will you incorporate the provisions of the document that Brenda forwarded
If you are bored would you please shepherd this letter going out
This was the one Michelle gave me
Kay I have everything I need with the exception of the wbs
I believe Allan is getting all that info for us
Do we have anything else to go on
Consolidation has its advantages and disadvantages
Please advise me of your thoughts on the consolidation
The document below contains the guts of the tasking letter I believe

I don't think I still have a copy
Kay Do you have a status on this
Could you call me about these at your convenience
Dave we will likely need your assistance in responding to the interrogatories

Below are some answers to your questions re

We will be selling power at their bus point
Will you be in this week
If not we can handle it with fax/fed ex
I will have to find a form
I don't think much will be required but I just want to make sure it is coordinated
In fact it is even a different Cogentrix counterparty
I couldn't find the long form/GTC in the Power Forms
Guess you would like the name of the counterparty
I aint making any payments until we get the official okeydokey
The closing docs are on top of my cabinet near my name plate
Anyway I'll prepare his resignation I was just wondering if he was an officer too

If so what will our involvement be and how many more megawatts are involved
What other costs might we need to be reimbursed for
How often will we email or fax them a sales summary

My apologies if you have already received it
At your option bids may be submitted for one two or three year terms
I hope that you had a wonderful Thanksgiving

I want to get this in the queue
Pursuant to my discussion with Mr
Swift I am enclosing a draft letter for your review
I did not have the certificate signed but will dig it out and see what I can do
Quite frankly I just overlooked it
Kay please advise me via e-mail of the results of your discussion with Steve Swift
If you received this in error please contact the sender and delete the material from all computers
Thanks for your response Kay
If yes I will revise that letter and have it executed by NorthWestern
The power is executed I just need to get the cert signed
Have you looked at the invoices that were in your inbox
If approved I can process tomorrow
If not by Noon I will forward to Carolyn George
I just couldn't help myself
I need Dave to sign one more document
Is he around
How do you like your new digs
See you in a bit
Digs are OK but it's odd that all this money was spent given our current circumstances
I wanted to follow up on a couple minor items
Kay do you or Alice have any invoices in your IBuyIt Inbox
If so why don't you forward them to me and I'll do them for you
I see they've halted the sending of replies
Here's the list of what we have so far
I asked Jeff Darst to sign and fax back to us
Yes but since we signed the power it seemed that someone else would actually execute the certificate
Were you able to locate the Certificate
Gives us something productive to do
If you aren't the right person who should I ask
Once it is agreed please send me an email with the revised number
I received the fax on Monday and they believe it was delivered here the Friday before
This will make you mad again
Could you send me the notice of default and our response
I have asked for something from GE indicating that Jeff D had the authority to sign the consent
I would think that this shouldn't take very long
How about any other deals you know about including the Mexico stuff
I suspect there may be a default there
Thought I would ask a more specific question
I think I still need the data sheet for this corp
I sent it to Ed with latest changes
The draft opinion is going to Davis Polk as we speak
Kate Cole had some comments on the Certificate of Secretary and I passed the comment along through Eric

I know that's a tough question

He really likes you
Do you need anything else from me at this time
Michael has his holiday performance
Hope you and yours enjoy the holidays
I hope this e-mail gets through to you
Just wanted to let you know that I'm thinking of you
I hope you come out of this mess ok
It would be great if you could expedite the invoices
I coded the King and Spalding invoices in IPAYIT yesterday
Before coding I had to forward the invoices to Ben for his approval
So they should be processed and paid soon through IPAYIT
Thank you very much for your prompt attention to this matter
For now Kay and I both will be working on this
Here is my shot at your memo
I will have the accounting spreadsheet from Theresa Vox today

They do the formatting and you supply the info

Is it scheduled to be paid
See if you can figure out how to get into this
Will you and Judy be attending
I think that we're too late for today so let's do it in the morning
I have not heard back from wasaff
Unless rod feels otherwise I would send the early termination
I assume you haven't received an answer from RMTC
Amelia asked if you were being a guest
Did you check with Judy and the kids
Rod I just signed the confidentiality agreement and will track down the ENA contracts asap
I'll let you know when I have them
Are you going to do anything about it
I think that a lot of people would like to know
Eric Do you have any ballpark idea about where an offer might come in
If so find out if he uses it and let Julie know
In fact I had never heard of her
So she has already effectively gone
Kim I would like to look further into getting onto the MOD Board
Until we can answer these questions we cannot terminate anything
How can we get these answers
I doubt that it is forecasted
I'll just have her call Tracy
Rick I guess that we are going to be s.o.l
Can we go direct to the beneficiaries
If I could hire him back I would
Let me know if I can help further
Could you shed some light on your experience with Mr Barrington
Cindy I will handle and respond to the attached
Also would you indicate what function each individual is responsible for eg. MOU Technical Regulatory Commercial or Legal
I will update the list once I have more information
Fran If Julie's merit needs to be lump sum just move it over to that column
Also send me Eric Gadd's sheets as well
As discussed attached are your sheets for bonus and merit
Steve It looks like you're going to need some help on your bonus numbers based on your team's performance
Use it if you need to
Stan I just glanced at your new org
After your decision I'll have Fran oversee the processing
Brian Brian Do we have the funds for this
If we want individual tickets we should make the request through Deb
Interesting isn't it
Pam Forget the monitor and video cart I had Julie order them off iBuyit today
I'll give her mine and Eric's
I try not to give it out unless absolutely necessary
Cool is it not
I got it pal
How sure are you that this deal will happen
If you don't think that's possible please advise and Julie can reschedule
I like the way you think
In preparation for your Wednesday meeting with Heath here are some supporting documents
This is the document Heath presented to his investment advisory board incl
It could be fun depending on how much running room they will let me have
Anyway you know before most El Paso people do so please don't mention anything just yet
Also I know it's tough times right now
All of us would love to have you attend
Let us know at your convenience
Is that a game we should play or not
Please call if questions or you wish to discuss
Eric I thought you had talked to Susan about covering for Julie on Friday afternoons
If you haven't talked with her I will I'd you'd prefer
Do you think he goes dove hunting with grenades
Dennis probably prefers that either you or Stan appear
Whether that comparison is to Current Estimate Forecast or both I don't care
Please advise as to what you want to do
Stan this has the attachment I refer to in the prior email
As Foothills and ANNGTC Mike Stewart and I are going to be appearing before that committee
I have Bob Hayes' Stock Option Grant Agreement
Should I forward it directly to him or would you like to give it to him
I will discuss with him in the morning
In my original request to the University for tickets her request was in the mix
My question is how do you want me to allocate the tickets I have so far
So everyone will be sending their worker bees only
Please let me know if this will work with your schedules
How do you think this one will go from here
Can't we stop it now
Let me know how that sounds
Danny I recommended on monday we cancel it...ken agreed yesterday
As long as we keep these two we could get by without them all together
Other than that they provide no value
We could do without it but I doubt we'd save money doing it ourselves
Joel I truly wish that I had something in my shop for you but I don't
I know that Duke is still hiring too
In any event let me know if there is something that I can do
The word is basically sell yourselves to someone or liquidate
Any suggestions on where I should start looking
When can we expect it to be available for viewing
Do you want me to have Julie arrange it with Claudia
Also What has happened to our move
Is it just for informative purposes
If so we might be able to arrange a group presentation at a later date
I defer to your judgement
Thanks for whatever you can do to help
Danny suggested that we have a schedule with you Joan and the assistants each covering one hour
Based on our efforts in Washington this week Friday could be a very busy day
Dan Ken Rice suggested that I contact you directly after a conversation we had
In discussions with people at NNG that was an area of unexplored opportunity. but I haven't gotten any resolution
I would appreciate a phone conversation if any of this sparks your interest
I appreciate the input
They discussed routes but that's all they did
Greg I have no interest for ETS
Kim and John I agree with Kim's second point
Can we clean this language up a little
I thought that was a covenant we wanted
This seems reasonable to me
Please advise if we can work with this
Kim I believe I have the schedules which I will fax to you for scanning
Kim sent me this new version over the weekend
Dave I haven't heard anything about Pacer for quite some time
Has there been any progress or have we dropped it
Kim and John I assumed that we'd moved away from that point in favor of the right to match
Dan are we no longer requiring a covenant re not using the ROW for gas pipeline activity
Dan I had drafted language which included both non-compete and right-to-match requirements for John's review
John rejected the non-compete but accepted the right-to-match which is ok with me
Panda will have to pay for the lateral to their plant
We would also welcome someone from you organization on the program should you wish
Because of the nature of this broadcast we expect the numbers to be much higher
And I think that it should be well received
I'll be in my office throughout the day
So look forward to your help
Please advise if you want to attend
I am sending you our latest presentation
Why would we be buying this as TW
Eric FYI I had my Assistant look back through call logs for the past ten weeks--John never called once

Janet I'd like you to talk with Rafael if you have time
Janet Yes he will be returning as an Associate
Is he returning as an Associate
Is Billy Lemmons coordinating his trip
Mark I hate losing Steve but the most important thing is keeping him here
As such he didn't receive all of the equity upsides that his counterparts did
I know a lot of people have and will continue to make runs at Steve
Unfortunately you were both in the air and I am away next week so I've run it anyway
Mark Would you send me a copy of your announcement
It's up to you now
How can I get one
Here's a quick summary of the bullets I discussed with Dennis
We will make our own
I think it's still pretty fuzzy don't you
What about our move

I would be happy to support Jeff
Sometimes it is great to be the old USA
Thank you for your words of comfort
I can't tell you how disturbed I was over this
I can't imagine how you are feeling

I thought he was done
Also I would like to see a list of all of our key people and their conctract expiration dates
I believe you have that but I've not seen a copy
The tournament was great to watch on tv so it must have been terrific to be there

The meeting in PDVSA-Gas was in his office
I will let you two know next week
Matthew Scrimshaw suggested I look you up
I'm fine with it
I am glad that you had a good meeting
I just talked with Andy Fastow and Brian Redmon

I'm the one who referred him to you and Larry
I thought of your groups as a possible fit
You make me smile
And you have the rest as well

I will probably not get much additional input from Caracas
I would not be surprised if he do it again
I am in India and Keith Miceli who covers South America for international public relations is in Brazil
If your contacts in Venezuela yield additional details please let us know
We should not miss this opportunity if it really happen

Let's discuss or leave me an email
I left you a voice mail regarding Sempra and Kinder Morgan
I doubt that Sempra will accept our offer
I like the progress
What do you suggest as a possible remedy
Without a cost plus methodology we could be very vulnerable here
Earnest money I like putting it in title company vs
I don't have any idea
I am fine with a quick closing date and needs specificity
Does he have an estimated time of completion
Rollback taxes I agree clarify as to the exemption we need to be protected here
Flare may want the money but we should try it
After you review and discuss these issues let's get together via phone and discuss outstanding issues
Therefore we spoke with him about this matter
In addition there may be some other changes we request
Under any circumstance we can dictate a letter to Mr Kent at the appropriate time
Should you have any questions or comments please call us
On the Norway front we need to implement the same organization structure
Jeff Let me know what you think
We have talked a lot about Thor and better communication but we need to make a change
I don't need to be an intermediary
If so does Mr Williams represent you or Flair Construction Co. Inc.
Please advise us accordingly
However often lots are free to be purchased by potential homeowners who then can choose the Builder they want
Therefore if this subdivision does not take off you will be under the control of the Developer
The foregoing was our general comments regarding the proposed Contract
This is something you may want to consider
However this cost would be yours to incur
Therefore the Seller is not providing you a survey of your actual lots
However we do not know what roads are being addressed and think that this sentence needs far more specificity
If there was ever an agricultural or timber exemption on this property you need to know
Please call us after you read and review this letter
Thank you for your email and ideas

Thus jeopardizing our chance to control the output of future plants or expansions
Nevertheless we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial control of the output
We did not include it now on purpose
Is this your intent to have a mismatch
So from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it as it is
Will we have to create a reserve
Is this in your model
Otherwise we would like to discuss this with you on Monday
Absolutely on the trader comment I forgot
I like the weather idea as well
On another note I met this guy when I spoke at the AA Energy symposium
He has given me his email address and requested a contact
Would you please make sure that someone follows up with him

Did it feel different actually being there
Are you going Miami

After we feel more comfortable and I feel good our assessment of talent I'd loosen the reigns substantially
Cathy before I forget would you please make a tee time of approx
Guys I received this today

FYI should we meet with this guy
Have we done anything with them especially with EOL
I sent this on to Gary and Jeff
I can personally speak for Dave as an outstanding performer
Good talking to you today
I couldn't print this out
Please call try on a different printer and if it still doesn't work get a hard copy
It sounds like we should talk to him
Who would you suggest we contact
The timing of it is amazing
We made these plans in advance of knowing your availability
Do you have dinner plans on Thursday evening
FYI are you aware of this
Were you planning to attend
By the way I don't have any photos all they would do is scare people especially me
I think I may have confused you a little
I'm not sure but I assume they will do another one next year
If so they might appreciate a new photo if they include an alumni section
It is basically their deal
The alumni did not help them on this project
Thanks for your outlines
Congrats on the getting non-binding bid I think
I didn't realize you were doing that that's great
Some months back it came to my attention that you have on occasion dropped by the house
I am not sure what you said or did but some of those actives now think you are God
I think with some hard work this will not be an insurmountable problem however
Sally Below is a draft of the official organization announcement that will address Brent and his team
After having conducted our first of several business reviews we'd like to outline the following organizational changes effective immediately

Please join us in congratulating everyone in their assignments
I've never sent you an email
If you have any questions please contact Greg Grissom at ext
Please add your changes ideas and corrections and return to me
I didn't but in anything about Cindy Skinner go ahead and add that as well
I don't have any pride of authorship here
I do have a question
He also has completed his law degree
I like this and it gives us something to start with
I hope this helps and gives you feedback as you wanted
With Jeff and my new responsibilities we have even less time to spend on this then before
PS I'm sorry but I forgot to address the sponsorship idea you had
I agree congrats
I accept and we're done
I look forward to doing business with you in the future
But upon reflection I think that needs to be re-addressed
Ideally the monetizers would close when we do
If we have to indemnify them in this area we will need to better understand the available insurance products
Commercially the deal makes sense and I am confident that we can structure around the risks
Please give me a call on this
A quick question before our meeting
Mark Haedicke and yourself or McMahon will remain
I keep up via old channels with your company
I'll give you a call when things settle down
I hope all is well with you and your family
I was on vacation last week and just read the announcment
Congratulations you are really getting up in the thin air now
Sorry I was unable to attend
I appreciate you including me in the notice
This really makes you realize what is truly important
I spoke to John on Saturday and at that point he seemed to be handling it well
As we discussed I am interested in opportunities within your group specifically the LNG arena

When I hear from her I'll let you what she says
Bob I hope all is well
Jeff do you know this publication
We have an opportunity that may interest your management team
Please let me know your thoughts ASAP
I suspect this window of opportunity will close quickly
Jennifer Thank you very much for your email
I can still watch everyone's success
I enjoyed working with you and your group
Best of luck to you in the future
Cool I don't know what it tells me but I love it
I think that should be looked at and re-evaluated

Per your request attached is the draft Business Plan for South America
Please let us know your thoughts
I will have an interest later
I would be happy to participate
I think you will really like this it is worth the time
I hope you are having a great holdiay
I won't be a stranger=
Hope we'll still see you out here in Tokyo
I do agree
Dave if Mike agrees - the easiest thing to do would be for you to ring Steve
This looks like another great opportunity for you
I know you keep a packed schedule
We'll work to accommodate it
Little if any advance preparation would be needed on your part
If both accept we will probably have one deliver in the morning and the other at lunch
Look forward to your reply
Bob thanks for the feedback and I enjoyed catching up as well
When we get closer to your conference I would be happy to give you a count for your intro

I'll ask Chris to call your better half
Congrats to you also
Hopefully we will get a chance to work together more often
I'll give you a call on my next trip to London
I hope you are having a successful trip
Tom as we discussed attached is the ENW presentation from the analyst show
How you determine your remaining representatives will be at your discretion
By the way science is Gary's passion and he has an undergraduate and MS in chemistry
Those guys better watch out you might organize them
FYI we have an investment in a company called Treasury Connect that has an interest rate swap portal
Gary is working with them to do a trade
On metals I believe all of that will remain under John Sherriff and not our new group
I like Cindy as well she sounds fine to me
I asked team to get you some org charts personnel numbers and PRC results on Friday
I'd like to discuss this with you next week
I got the pictures yesterday
What is your best and final total price for the work
Dear Mike Please let me know that the photos arrived

As promised you will find attached samples of our work.
For example we produce interactive CD-ROMs Tech animations and Trade Show presentations.
I appreciate your time and attention.
David I got your latest comments this morning
I like them and added the correct Enron Net Works changes

On your other issue I understand and we'll discuss
When convenient I would like to talk to you about what that means for the South Amercia Networks effort
Also for what it is worth I am assessing personal options at this point
Mike will not focus on acquisitions in his speech
With regard to the focus of your presentation I have written a suggested session description below for your review
Actually I thought the Sept conference was aimed at this type of crowd as well
CP check out my emails
As you can tell my trip wasn't all fun
I left a few emails from various speaking forums
Matt I did receive it and sent it on

I got this from mike late last week
We need to be helpful if it will help his business
Dan are you up to speed on this
If not please call him and get his viewpoint as well
I'll let Philippe know although he should have already been aware of this
Call me or Kelly Johnson if you have any questions
Can we make this happen and when would it occur
I don't think you got a copy of this
I stepped in while he was out of town on holiday
Under the execution section the work program identifies the priority processes and the contacts we will initiate interviews with
They look fine to me
I know that is the plan i'm kidding
Yes I would like a complete review of your initiatives
Do you want to start tracking these kinds of initiatives too
I will be in all next week
We can review that Monday and agree on its content
Louise agreed to review it as well
Remember we are only setting up people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified
I don't have his name yet but we have him and one more on the way
I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave
We have a few holes but it is not that far away
Let me know what Mark Palmer says
He knows we have been using Margaret

Would you be available tomorrow some time
Wade I had a good discussion with Hemant
Philippe I don't really understand this guys question
Can you send me to the right person
Anyway I'm asking for your assistance
Again your guidance is most appreciated.
Now you know we don't have the room
We got in and its working fine
The only catch is that it must be unique
You can reach me on my cell phone anytime
I am writing this from my bed and I am improving
Thanks for your help and I'll see you soon
Also looking forward to seeing you
Thursday sounds great and just let me know about Friday
On Friday I believe that in the proposed meeting with Softbank a presentation is not necessary
Despite what you have heard this place is not as foreign as rumored
I normally get a driver I am uncomfortable in new countries that I can't speak any of the language
One more item could you please have your assistant set up a message for me at the hotel
Thursday's schedule is fairly set and we are working on Friday
This would take us through mid afternoon
I am looking forward to the upcoming trip
I would appreciate some suggestions and I will need a guide could you have someone arrange it for me
I'll let you know later
I did talk to Skilling about this
I must have forgotten to call you
Jeff really does want it around you were correct
How much will it really save
I think this is the best thing to do for Enron
I certainly agree
I expect so but please let me know
I don't know how much it will help however
Perhaps a phone call by you might help
My work experience so far has been excellent and nothing less than what I had hoped for
These are beliefs which I have been raised on by my father and really believe to be true
I will work on it
If I don't follow-up after that please email me again
If they aren't available they can pick an appropriate person
PB what do you think
Please place this date on your calendar
If you are not able to attend the meeting I will appreciate you sending a representative
In the future is there one individual I should contact rather than the two of you
CP Please fill in my meetings on my calendar as we normally do
I am very sorry for your loss
I will have a discussion along these points
I'll wait to get the pictures it will definitely help
I miss understood about the photos I thought you were sending me via email that next day
Congrats on the Cassatt that person will really enjoy it
I like to have all my art shipped because the tax savings can be significant especially in New York
I will speak ot Mr Hubert about the price however are you interested in the frame
Please wait for the images if you like and we will speak soon
I sent it on to John
I am forwarding this email from John regarding the J-Block problems
Have you been involved in this
If you have any ideas or can provide with some help please follow-up
When he mentioned this I really couldn't remember much
Jeff McMahon will add a page on finance as well give him a call for a draft
On further emails only send me change or new pages
I glanced at the presentation
Could we use our older machines for home use
They are still very good they just aren't the newest technology
That would reduce our initial costs significantly even for NA
I will co-ordinate an executive dinner
Thanks for taking the time to visit with me
By way of follow-up I would like to confirm my understanding of the action items
Eric is the key to all your activities
We wanted to be fairly specific but not tip our hand regarding project timing or exact location
We'll ask for suggestions on local law & engineering firms plus see what Sam can do to help us
I agree with Eric
Mike We are putting together a presentation based on the discussion we had during our call the other day
What kind of packages would it take to attract that talent
Do we have the right people and trading staff there
I am Cathy Phillips Mike McConnell's assistant and I am responding to your message of his behalf
For some reason I couldn't get this off to you sooner
Thanks for your co-operation
Allan Thanks I'll add them to the list
I really enjoyed meeting with you last Saturday at your gallery
I am considering the Mary Cassat as a gift for her
I believe that will also drive the structure
You and Jeff talks about a senior position for me
Today he does all these senior structuring deals with EGM products
If we look at everything at once - nothing will happen
How will it be integrated
I have no problem with say reporting liquids etc to John Nowlan Softs to Gary weather to Mark
We have the book but we do not have any real support from Houston or real responsibility
You mentioned Singapore in the TC what will happen with them
I sent your info on to my direct reports for evaluation
If there is an interest you will be hearing from us
I will be buying in next day or two
I will keep the Lautrecs in mind
I think one is in my future - next
I don't think I'll be buying one for a few months
If you disagree with it or want to discuss some realignments let me know
I have made note to your new email address
When I make it over to London again you will be one of the first that I contact
Could you send me your home number and address
And great to hear from you again
Yes certainly the world has changed since we last met
So even though London probably is high on the hit list I have not changed my lifestyle significantly
I am trying to face out the old one since it has caused me endless problems
What are yours
I think she did them last night
Attached are the links to the places Sarah and I went

I can certainly make it out there on my own
I look forward to seeing you in the elevator banks
I also enjoyed meeting you two weeks ago
So Mark you can't say I never gave you anything
Steve would you please help this lady
Both offenses looked like they were playing very good defenses
I do like our coaching staff
Bob hasn't always had things go his way
That being said he has had a pretty good string lately
Until somebody beats y'all you should be number one as far as I am concerned
I will say that both defenses looked tough
I love our staff but unfortunately I think we were outcoached
That being said Bob Stoops could be the luckiest coach in the world...everything seems to fall his way
Good luck to you guys
I hope the game is a good as the hype
Again I can't wait
Uhhhhh I think I'll make the drive myself
Great glad to hear you will venture out to the burbs all by yourself

In fact I initiated the invitation on behalf of me and you
Are you free? are they free? I don't even know if I'm free
What did they say
I did not make it partly because I was tired and I had several errands to take care of
Hello sir how are you
Well I tell you Pastor really outdid himself yesterday
I really enjoyed his sermon
Tasha and I got so tickled watching you sing that song
Well anyway talk to you later
It's a nice small church but those folks crack me up
I was so embarassed that my chuckle came out
So just remind me I will never go back over there
I sure hate that you missed seeing the baptismal pool
I was a little unnerved especially with the kids
I had the kids put on their shoes and socks and whatnot just in case something happened
I was a praying sister
That really scared me
Then to top it off the weather got really cold this morning
Oh well talk with you later

I don't understand him
Dan Grant Oh suggested I e-mail you directly to notify you of a change that BP needs included
Girl did you see Jesse Jackson on TV

He needs to pick his campaigns to bolster up his credibility
Everybody over here is watching it very very closely
I'm tired of hearing about it
How are things over your way
My day yesterday was okay Todd cooked us dinner before he went to work I was shocked but appreciative
Speaking of church do you know that Robin told m that Greg lives in million dollar house
Remember when Hope said that his light bill was super high it probably was correct
I want to see this house
Boy it looks like this is really going to be a tight tight race
That way you've communicated your desires in a concise professional manner
I'm back and I had a wonderful time
The wedding itself was in a small church but somewhat elegant
It was in a real nice resort and it was money money money
Again I hope she did not go into too much debt but it was nice

I wasn't sure if it transmitted or not
I really haven't made any plans but maybe we'll go visit my family in Omaha
It's really hard for me to plan b/c I may have to work some of the week
I'm not sure yet so I hate to plan a vacation that may have to be interrupted
Thanks for the note that was very sweet of you
I always believe in helping wherever I can b/c the next day it'll be me
Well I guess I won't see you until Sunday Keep the faith and don't give up

He's a trip but it was a good sermon
Please show me a bid for this Cargill Deal

Just tried to call you
Please call me before you leave and yes you probably need to leave but where will you go

I'm not trusting his reactions or your own right now
Please do not put yourself in that position
Also do you have a copy of the GTC
We have no idea what it is and we're looking for the non-performance language associated with it

I'm not surprised about Hope it was such a late night

Thanks for your help and also thank Darla
Thanks for checking on me
On one hand it gave me a real good idea of what type of shape Daddy really is in
It's not real good but he feels optimistic
He's definitely has his good days and his bad days
You didn't tell me that Jennifer changed her name
I called her cell phone and left a message and it gave her real name not her slave name
I cracked up
Seems like the older people get the crazier they get
I called Dale and spoke with her for a few minutes
Missed you at Jordan's party

Yes you are absolutely correct I can never get ahold of you
I know you're very busy
You never did call me back
I looked for you guys and I said oh well I'll catch them later
It's always too crowded and it drives me crazy
It's not the best plan but it beats a Friday Saturday or a Sunday
See you soon!

He's drive us crazy

Yes I'll see you there
In fact I was on my way home when you and I were talking
We sounded like crap...I was so embarassed I actually got so hot and started sweating because of my embarassment
I just thought about that when your e-mail arrived
I hate that it hurts but most men do end up regretting their previous behavior
I know what you mean about your Dad
When are you suppose to see the lawyer

The lady call me about the apartment the prospect that was there before I was did not get it
She offered the apartment to me

I asked her what was her secret and she said medical plus a lot of prayer
I just wanted to know what she took to lose it
I heard that Cynthia lost a lot too
Attached is the job posting per our conversation

The only other issue is their Guaranty to Enron
Having said that I would prefer they draft the amendment

I could be wrong but I believe that the only industrial Cary spoke to was Cargill
Can you forward Cary's old industrials info to Patrice

I wish I could join you now
I bet that is a change for them and alot less expensive for you
I really like what I'm doing
Kendall what can I say
I hate to see her go but if it's best for there family then go for it
I have been thinking of you alot lately
I finally had to call Laura Vuittonet
In fact for the first time since I had my kids I feel very rested and at peace
I could use another day of alone time
Anyway I hope all is well for you
I'll call you after trading
You hurt my feelings b/c you didn't wait for my call
Not as of yet but it sounds like maybe shortly
I don't do you

I hope everything is going well for her
She called me again yesterday with some silly stuff
Girl you are so-oo crazy

Doesn't it make you feel good when the kids admire you
I can relate to that warm fuzzy feeling brought on by your child
I can't wait to see the pictures
I wonder how expensive that job will be
I was wondering where Samantha had been myself
Do you have a hat for next Sunday
After church I went home & cooked spaghetti
I didn't want to go but Steve asked me to
On the way home he wanted to talk
She really expressed herself
I was proud of her for speaking up
She was very respectful but got her point across
When we got in bed he wanted to snuggle up under me
I then asked him where he had gone the other night
I'm his wife and can't ask where he's been
I should know where he is at all times
I just really don't have time for his mess
So in what area would you like to purchase a new house
So far I really could have taken the day off and would not have missed anything
Last night I had a date with my mother-in-law
I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated
I felt like a million dollars in my semi-formal attire
The top that I bought set it off so nicely
Boy I felt good about my appearance
Made my evening
How did your evening go last night
I said fine have fun
I am so bitter I'm ready for a change too
Right now it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much
All we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different independent activities
Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos
How is your day going so far
Fine I hope
I don't know what else to do
I've prayed and given it to God but she still struggles
Keep her lifted up in prayer
She wrote me a letter last night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart because she's not
She said that she's dumb because her report card says so
That hurt me so bad
Did any of your customers call you back
Girl that's my dilemma as far as a house is concerned
Girl I hope the plumbing isn't too expensive as well but it has to be done
When I answered the phone I recognized her voice immediately and I got scared that something had happened
I'm doing fine I just sent Tarsha an e-mail and I hit the send button and there you are
I had a good time with my boys this weekend
What I didn't realize was that they were designer shoes

It's a good thing they have this on record
I will most definitely keep your father in my prayers

He is blessed and we're praying for God to heal him
You all alone give him the strength to keep fighting

Are you going to rehearsal tonight
Well I did buy that cute dress from Lane Bryant with the shirt to match
Honey I was a fox in that dress at the wedding on Saturday
I missed the wedding but made the reception
When I walked in the room all eyes were on me
For once I didn't feel self conscious about my arms
My husband was all over me and giving me compliments
Several of his cousins told me how good I looked also
My weekend was great visiting with my family
It's really sad he is so small and frail
He's starting to get his appetite back somewhat
My sister and I threw down on Easter dinner

Anyway needless to say that is my new crusade
If you could please tell me is there a difference between the execution of longer and short term contracts
Answer There is no process it just depends on what type of trade your end-use customer desires
Answer Misrepresentation if you don't know and you are not sure please communicate this to your potential buyer
We do it all the time and we don't go around you
Oftentimes it gives the end-use customer a comfort level that an experienced reputable company is backing you
Answer I'll have to let you know,take care

I just hope he understands
If there is anything I can do from hear just let me know
I have graduation tonight so I will probably be home late
After she fed daddy thru the tube he upchuck again
After my doctor's visit with Daddy on Thursday I had a hard time dealing with it on Friday
Everytime someone would ask me about it I would start crying
Even though he is eligible he is not ready to take that final step
Daddy is still very optimistic as we all are
It is very important that his attitude stays positive

The contract clearly gives us this right
I haven't specifically reviewed the contract but I am assuming it is our standard form
I will check this
Lauri I reviewed the contract with TGLO
It is a standard interruptible form so we should have no issues with interruption of the gas flows
I also talked further with Dan concerning the contract
This argument is not a slam dunk but we should probably take this approach and see how they react

Rent goes up and it is a month earlier
I'm going to cut the check and pay him on time
If so then we can likely proceed with the payment
If not how do we proceed in the manner proposed below
My view is that we cannot return this without court approval
Given the cumulative size of these payments I don't think we should go forward without court apporval
If it does I think that further complicates the analysis

If you want me to go to any of these please let me know
I will be out Wednesday through Friday on vacation

Please let me know if you agree that we should attend

Fine with me on the pools
In the west we named a marketer a cash trader and an attorney to coordinate on each transmission company
For the Pools I think that Govt Affairs should be the Primary Point of Contact
For the individual Transmission Providers I think that the Real-Time Desk/Logistics should be the Primary Point of Contact

I would not pay alot for this given the transmission issue
Would you like me to include Trading in the email
Obviously the QSE part I need to keep
I have a staff mtg
We need to lock him down ASAP
Also I am concerned that Narsimha may have someone from the outside trying to recruit him

Do you still want that order in the system
If not let me know so I can cancel

I have some ideas
I will talk to him today to gauge his interest
Sounds like he might fit in the LMP/transmission/congestion management group
As I mentioned we are attempting to create an Eastern Interconnect LMP model to model congestion in every region
Doug Gilbert-Smith and Harry Arora have okay'd their people/locations
Feel free to call me on Sunday if needed
I know we aren't in the market for assets right now but I wanted to pass on the information
With respect to volumes for term trades the risk group will have to provide that to you

I haven't even considered giving the others any access
I am getting more like you every day
Given what's going on in EES right now I don't trust anyone
Therefore I am going to allow access to the portal to only EWS employees that you are comfortable with
Who should we talk to
I don't want any of our screens visible to the customers not matter who they are
Or would you like me to follow-up
How many days do I have left
After playing around some more I have a new way that works fine for me
With respect to the URM employees under Dale please grant them the more limited access
So we are seeing action as a result of consistent pressure
I have received this feedback directly from Rogers and Janet
I am happy to compete on price the question is how much damage does this do externally
He is long so he better
If Doug's curves are inacurate then we need to resolve
I will look to you to arrange this
Please call if you would like to discuss
Hopefully you will get it this time
How exactly are we exposed
This assumes we lose the entire contractual commitment
I am also anticipating additional credit related exposure
We do not however have our daily volatility curves in the same granularity
This is where the support of your group is requested
As you can see I don't have much information of the objective here
Thank you for your patience I realize in many ways that this has been a long road
No my understanding was we were going to give them curve access
I never agreed to give them the fundies data
Unfortunately I spend entirely too much time at work but I love the job and Enron's culture in general
Did you grow up in the Tri-Cities Washington and attend Bethlehem Lutheran School
I also went to BLS and was your classmate
Drop me a line if I have the right person
Give me a call this weekend
Please let me know if you are interested in purchasing tickets
Please print and save for our Lake McQueeney trip
The balance will be between location lot size and how nice you may want the existing structure to be
The more I think about it this lake is ideal for where you live
It is open weekends only through mid October I believe
To whom should I send this resume

Are we are discussing the Phoenix project at this Wednesday's meeting
I am not sure I agree with Starwood
As for TYCO I think the verdict is still out on this as well
Overall I want to reflect fair value on the re-books not extreme conservatism
Sounds like you are as busy as I am
Yes my parents still live in the same house in Kennewick
I will let you conclude which business model is better
You have a better memory than mine but I believe that you are right
I have not stayed in touch with anyone from that area
Although my parents still live outside of Pasco
Do your parents still live in the Tri-Cities
How do you like Houston
Since the last time I saw you I went to the U.W
I gravitated to the D.C area for international work where I have remained since then
I would inevitably get sick when I went there
It must be an interesting job I would like to hear more about it
I cover the West Coast and Dallas area
So far I like the company
I'm also doing my MBA at Georgetown right now
I have both days on my calender
Is it Wed or Thurs
I have it as Thurs this week
As usual your position is way too logical
Do I need to attend this meeting
As I said in my last tariff strategy meeting I would be glad to give URM to Ozzie too
I would hope not but I am curious to see what position Dave tries to drive
I will let you know what comes out of it
My understanding is that Shell can put them back to Calpine
I am sure you saw this article y-day
I wonder what will happen with all of those Calpine MW
Also we would get some exposure to what other players in the market are thinking
Kevin Don and Mike I think any of you might find this worthwhile if you have the time
Due to the limited available seating at this late date I will call you to discuss registration details
Thanks for all your good work
Let me know if you'd like me to attend
Does it include capacity
Is it a daily call
I want only firm delivered LD offers for this position
I'll keep you informed as I receive responses
Please pass on the information to you trading desks
Overall I am very bearish and my position reflects that
Like you I have worn some curveshift the past month
Weird price action today it looks like to me
Overall the Dow tells it all
Therefore we should continue to fight this issue hard to rectify as soon as possible
Also Enron has sold its control areas
M is certainly good for precedent but Southern can still keep its Att
If you need a more formal document indicating this I would be happy to send one to you
I can meet mid-morning tommorow
Have you heard from her
I generally agree with your approach
I have expressed this concern to EES Origination
I don't need to attend
Did you want to attend
We look forward to seeing you in Las Vegas
If there is a positive NPV trade we should do it
I think the legislators are beginning to realize this
If Kim cannot attend I need to move the meeting to a time when she can be there
Yes we probably can because ESCA is the vendor and we have a great relationship with them
I will ask Doug and/or Forney to follow-up
Given the Senate hearing results from Friday I would certainly start building in some margin
So the latest we should know there is going to be a delay is Thanksgiving
In addition we should be able to get access to the chairs of this committee if need be
Please call me and I will give you the real story
I don't want to put it in an e-mail
Is toronto our responsability to make happen
UDC rates are going to increase significantly as we discussed
Amazing we were just discussing this in am
I am perfectly fine with this approach
In my opinion it signals a softening of their stance
Is it a problem with the business or him
I will follow up on monday morning
I am assuming this will be corrected today
Does it retain my custom profile
I have had a few people come over and leave suggestions for lunch...Zydeco Chinease different type of Italian
Zydeco is Cajun...do you have any other suggestions

What time are we meeting
However we will need a bigger room
I realize there are significant issues to be addressed
I will forward this e-mail to EOL and Legal
I understand his point
Anyway he said he has had heartburn with the way EOL notifies users of contract/confirm changes
I would be glad to continue to facilitate discussions if necessary
You know what we really mean
Wanted to give you some updated thoughts
Firstly we are writing down demand sharply in the U.S and around the globe
While we are still refining our thinking that is a shocking number
Now we the odds are looking bad
Lastly emissions -- I am scheduled to have a reasonably high level discussion with Senate Environmental committee
That is likely bullish unless you discount future values heavily which we do

Therefore I am attaching the brief overview paper below to provide a bit more background for you all
If you have any questions please let me know and I will try to answer them

I'm still awaiting offers from JEA/TEA which they said should be available in the next few days
Have they started construction

Doug Gilbert-Smith runs our Texas power group
Yes I will call you tonight or tomorrow to give you an update
Can I use you as a reference

I think that with the right opportunities he will do very well
Also I have been in contact with a Craig Carmichael
Could you provide a contact for a short conference call
Eric Gadd Eric I can send the model with curve fetch functionality to Mike Ratner
From my perspective somebody in your organization would be the most rationale choice
Here is the model we were reviewing this afternoon minus the curve fetch function
It is imperative that each of you participate in the meeting
However I spoke to Don and I think we are back on track
Based on what Fletch and Doug are doing I would increase your #'s significantly

I do not agree with this approach
I strongly object to your recommended approach

He can expense it
What do you think on this one
Also we are going forward as discussed with Decker and Zurita

I am working on the Natural Gas derivatives desk

If you need a reference please talk to Harry Arora
Are you comfortable
Can you please add Rogers to the interview list
I like Dale as a candidate to run the URM desk
If Jay leaves we are big time short
Many of you know Dale Furrow already
In short he would be a great catch for us
I will be in Houston Monday and Tuesday of next week
I will interview Dale on Tuesday
I know that Louise and John are in PRC on Tuesday so they would have to do it later
Perhaps the rest of us could meet him on Tuesday
I don't yet have a specific job nailed down for him
Andy based on my interpretation of your memo we are not tracking each other
Sounds unbending but we must get a level playing field
Can you make sure and attend
Could you please forward this to the traders
I am now a member of the Enron team
Thanks for getting me in the door
They have agreed to grant us access
I have also asked for the PRB curves as well

Thanks Matt Do you have that same information for the two PRB coals
Do you have a Coal Curve for Today
Also do you know the Curve Code for the curve that you send me
Please print the agenda for myself and fax copy to Evelyn
Thanks for your help in facilitating this transition
As you say below with regulatory risk lies marketing opportunities
Take advantage of the changing regulatory landscape don't use it as a crux
I look forward to discussing with you on Monday morning
Yes my brother
Please join us in welcoming Darin to our Portland office
If we have any extras I will throw them your way
I would appreciate it very much
It is becoming increasingly difficult to put non-managers under contract so that is my challenge for the hourly group
Having said that I concur with your suggestions
However I am not sure what the status is with Rudy and Miguel
Also I would like to postpone our Monday meeting
Presented Narsimha this am asked him to read it and give me comments
I think they were both very good packages
I hope narsimha is pleased
So we will see how he responds - I think the package was very fair with continued upside
Call me with any additional questions
Can we plan to speak sometime today/tomorrow
I hear you on the liquidity Rogers
Please trust me on this issue
The pool is blowing up as we speak
However it is hard not seeing anything on EOL
Is there a value proposition for us
If necessary I will follow-up
Just to prove that I don't play golf everyday
My good friend Ozzie and I met about site profile
He agrees that it should be with Demand Side Management
He also agrees that Jay should do it with him
If you want IT development than include your IT person as well
I think we also need retail capability in ERCOT
Make sure we get something in writing
I will discuss later
The risk is there and it is real
However we need to recognize all the risks
We did not agree though that this in any way limited our risk from a business perspective
With your retail short position in PJM I assume we are short ICAP as well
Hopefully it is in E PJM
Yes I think so
Do you need to me to do something
Can we get Meyn under contract cheap
Do I need to attend
Aside from the professional skills and energy the people here have become good friends of mine
Good luck to you all
I think we finally have everthing
Kevin Are you still having problems getting the curves for crude products and coal
When I get more info. I will discuss the opportunity further with you
I think you are probably correct
Upon closure you will probably be marking your own curves
Having said that you should probably begin now
Will we definitively be given access to your curves
I simply need to make it a priority again
I can go either way though
As we discussed a new team has been assigned to cover your account
We have reviewed our curves and feel they are very reasonable
I will continue to investigate
Hopefully the database will be back up tomorrow and you will be able to see the report as usual
Please send me a resume before I agree to any meeting
How does your schedule look today or Tuesday
I keep the curves very tightly controlled due to proprietary reasons
I lose control of who has access outside my group therefore I have chosen to not make it available
Kevin I have not received any news from you
Kevin I work in EIM Fundamentals Steel group
I thought we already did this
Do you want me to see if I can do this
Kevin - do you and Jeff agree
I guess we could classify them as Origination
If I could see some off-peak markets I would be buying
Unfortunately I know info like this will just be used against me and the positions I am fighting
I look forward to hearing from you and the information you mentioned you will send my way
I don't think it's appropriate to shut down anything
Am I making sense
Could you please take care of this for me today
I will try to talk to him on this
Please handle for me ASAP
Love the spread given my view of natty
You are certainly free to call him if you want
I just received this
I would be interested in your views of our views
The bottom line is it was painful putting that spread on
Look at my coal markets
As you finalize the personnel issues any information regarding which trader will be managing each location is extremely helpful
I defer to Dana on this issue
Would you be open to considering an associate role for him
I can't think of any of their employees I would want
Did you check with Liz
They are all taken however if anyone cancels I'll put him on the waiting list
I will do Carson and Juan
I am having Juan do all of his SE hourly group
With respect to Forney I will either do myself or have Doug do it
If you agree we can forward to Juan and I will coordinate
I can go either way with these - let me know
I can easily do them I just need some mid-year facts and recent obeservations
Honestly it doesn't look good...so I can check with our contact directly
Please put in my address book
If you have any specific questions as to the meeting objectives call Rogers Jeff or myself anytime
Kevin can you confirm
Please respond at your earliest
Thanks in advance for your prompt assistance
This is the spread option which I am able to reconcile

Please change her in the system to her correct direct report
I confirmed he signed a couple weeks ago
I'm sure you are OK with this
I already read this article

Fortunately I have been doing a good bit of hedging my long Enron position
I simply look at the change in daily postions
Both Lavo and I are OK with the current reports
We can call you from my office
Hi Tim Thank you the phone message about your continued interest in PIRA Energy Group

With Rogers transitioning to run our retail risk management I would like to clean up our customer positions
I did look and couldn't find it
When can I get this done
I'm sure Vlady can get it to you
In general I don't save my e-mails
If I can find it
I think we will significant synergy benefits immediately
In the interim Fletch and I will assume responsibility
Obviously we will be trying to identify a replacement over the next couple of months
I will give you the specifics before we mark
Don't know his capabilities well enough to make an accurate assessment
I forgot to clarify with Kim on original offer
Remember we have to go through Paul Johnson at Austin Energy

I think you forgot the cash postion
I would rather have on-line valuation even if the $'s aren't perfect
Mr Presto Why don't I just do this for you on a monthly basis
Please elt me know if you have trouble opening it
I already signed something on this
Unless I hear otherwise I am going to ignore this e-mail
If you have any questions let me or Lloyd know
We are in receipt of your FIST subscription
Let me figure something out for the online portfolio
I think you forgot the cash position
Therefore we don't need to proceed with the diesel installation
With respect to Ameren Ron should work directly with me and Lloyd Will
Should he follow up with Terri
Fine with me if Hunter and Lavo can support it
And she wants to report Calger and Milnthorp
Hunter and I think it is very important
As such I have decided to clean it up and I have several ideas
Are you a mind reader
Make sure TJ puts on my calender
Wednesday doesn't work for me
I will have to move my weekly meeting to Tuesday
Did you happen to sign your employment agreement
This is pretty easy math for me
I know it seems like a stretch but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now
I would like to get this done ASAP
Let me know your thoughts...then I will run it by Oxley
Are we going to attend
In addition I did speak with Don regarding the increase in the price for the Summer offtake
Do you have a list of people for the special trip
Tim were you going to be in Houston this month
If so it might be easier to do it then
Can we pull this together in the next couple of weeks
This will continue to be my message unless you feel otherwise
I'll confirm dates with you later today or tommorow
I believe this is the best choice- Great hotel close to town with golf tennis fishing right there
Let me know what you think and we'll book it
I think Steve would fit in with our group well
We should have something to present to you Lloyd and Kevin by Thursday
If there are others in your group who need access please let me know
Kevin feels that his original deal based upon the cost of the plant at the time should be honored
I have given my views and they are falling on deaf ears
I wanted to give you a quick update on this
Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any points
This would keep us from entering any new data
In the future we should mark the curves as $/Kw-month
Again we ran into problems with the test database
Carson is done and I just talked with Suarez
I also called Suarez yesterday and left a message but haven't heard back yet
No I won't be using
Kevin you have been given one ticket to the game from the Services Desk
I guess that's fair
That is my impression as well and that is why I set= up the Monday meeting
Please let me k= now if you have any questions or need clarification on any points
This would keep us from= entering any new data
In the future we should mark the cur= ves as $/Kw-month
Long term your portfolio manager should know how to value options
I called the PaineWebber online services
This portfolio I can update monthly for you or as often as you wish
Glad we got this resolved
On the way back you would fly on the company plane and Zufferli would fly commercial directly to Calgary
Are you guys in
If I have too I will dip into my money
You will probably be glad you didn't go
If the boys are in jail in Mexico you may have to run the desk the next week
Rogers can't attend due to family conflict therefore you will be on the corporate jet
This short list will not include your individual group PRC meetings
I believe that there has been some confussion
Please check with your HR rep for details
PS Although I am up in NY about half the time I am still a Houston based employee
Means broken and needs fixed - like your Mercedes
As a reminder this move was deferred by Keith as per his request back in the original offer letter
As you know the household goods shipment is billed direct to Enron
Jeanne could you give us a status and outline the necessary action steps for Keith
Jeanne I will be moving in about six weeks from Louisiana to the Woodlands
Keith was assigned to Jeanne Seward as his consultant
Can you contact Keith to discuss the timeline
Thanks for recommending that I call Hunter he found a spot for my guy
I spoke to Dave Duran regarding Bill Rust
I would recommend that we discuss him in our PRC meeting
Who would you suggest as the supervisor
Below are contacts if you need help over the weekend with new docs employee questions etc
For people not committing try to get there contracts back so we can re-allocate $'s as necessary
If you need new docs printed please contact Amy or Jeanie at above #'s or call me
Harry - You and your guys situation is different therefore ignore the Sunday issue
The way you set up the portfolio is very confusing
Yes I think we should make a formal break
I think we could roll all of this out at once
In addition make sure we understand the steam obligation and it's effect on dispatch flexibity and heat rate
Make sure we are modeling these dynamics properly
Can you check into this problem
Can you make this the default view setting
I hope this translates in P instead of L
Wow - It looks like you have the lingo down now
We can ignore it for the DASH
If so please put on my calender
Please RSVP to LaDonna if you are unavailable
If you could please give your approval we can begin testing
You have the latitude to put your key people under contract
I had a discussion with Berney last night re Edith
I think we need to consider putting her under contract
Also I think hearing some assurances from you and/or Lavo would probably be appropriate with her
Berney and I are having lunch with Edith today
I will provide you with feedback and direction after our lunch
I am ready to compete
No doubt I will be a peak performer
I support this
This wan an oversight on our part
Tell me what you think
Is it necessary to have a better resume format
Have we looked at associate rankings yet
Yes I am very busy today
I will get back with you tommorow or Friday
What division of Enron does he work for
I told Dave Duran we have no interest and I'm not going to waste my time on this individual
On balance I do not see any problems with the transmission system in the immediate area surrounding Racoon Creek
If you have any questions or would like to discuss let me know
I ALSO CONTACTED THE COMPANY THAT CONTROLS OUR DAYCARE CLAIM FORMS
Ahhh you foolish foolish little man
I need something I can take to the bank
I think they would give you a gas card

Before I start my day I have been at home thinking how awful I was last nite
There are MANY other ways to show my emotions to you
What kind do you like

I just need to give Mark Taylor the right name
Going forward I can help you with any issues you have regarding financial confirms

Thanks for your great efforts thus far
I will be in later today
I apologize for this mishap

I second that
Maybe it was Richard that we should have been blaming
No we just suck
I am tired of your bad karma
Take care and see you soon
I need to schedule an hour with you this week
Do you want us to meet you in John Arnold's office
Can we copy it over to be used
Below I've detailed your assignment for the upcoming week
Dutch I need the bid/offer spread as well
For each transaction I need the prevailing bid/offer spread
Could you get that quickly
I will wait for that right now
Okay you don't save them
Dutch Texas Independent Energy is looking for fixed price gas for their two power plants
Please send me back your offer
Is it the forward curve
Is it the spot market price
And if we are having users trade basis we will need different prices for different locations right
So if they are X dollars long they have a VaR of Y
Lastly when could you meet with me next week
I would really like to meet on Tuesday if possible
Can you kill the deal in the system please
I get Monday off
Just a few notes to let you know what's going on
Lori at Smith Barney was not in Friday so we did not settle
I don't know how you handle this
Hopefully they will do this on Monday
I know this is a terrible welcome back but it was something that had to be done
Thanks for the call I was on vacation
Lets set up a time to talk later in the day is best for me
Let me know when is a good time for you
Dutch How are you today
Do you have any suggestions
Team Here are my comments on Futures
In addition we need information on Financial option
Dutch Dutch Thanks a million for your prompt support
Need your offer
Should know by the end of the week about my job
Good to know that you are still out there
How are you doing these days
I thought about you when I heard about Enron
Were you affected
Give me a call and we can meet up sometime
I will make a tally of which day is best so please reply
I look forward to hearing from all of you
I am still working
How are you doing work and personally
It has been a pleasure getting to know you
I was going through my voice mail on my old ext

Hope you are having a good Monday
Dutch - please send me the numbers
We need to determine how much we need Fimat right now
We need to reschedule our meeting to some time next week
Also could you send me your homework assignment for me to review and place into the ECW
Upon speaking to Paul at EDF Man he told me that no money would be transfered

I thank you for your help in this matter
Thanks Sarah Sarah Are you involved in this
When I called to confirm Paul tells me that no money with be transfered
Please call me if any questions or concerns
I will get that to as soon as it is done
Hi Dutch I hated to call you to tell you I still don't have an answer from EDF Man
I'll let you know as soon as I do
Gerri Did he say why he could not confirm the money transfer
I'll let you know asap
Gerri Do you know who pays the brokers commissions each month
Gerri They David Early told me that you have already been contacted that the money would come over
They told me that it would
So I begining to wonder about those guys
Have you settled into a groove yet
This past weekend was great for me
I spent the entire weekend with Kay we had dinner with my parents on sat
It has been working well for me
Hope all is good with you
I thought we were all going somewhere on Sunday
Can we get out there early
I am not sure if you have the extension for me
Will let you know when I hear anything
What did you call for Sunday
Please let me know if you make any progress
Pursuant to our conversation
This is the risk we would like to swap out
In working out the details we've come across a few questions that we know you can help us answer
Is it NYMEX
Is it prices of the instruments
Thanks in advance for your help Dutch
Kingwood Cove it is
Live the next few days to the fullest they might be your last
He asked about it I looked it up and got us a tee time
If anybody wants to get a tee time somewhere else that is fine with me
With Richard playing and the boys from Austin playing I think that Kingwood is a happy medium
We could try Brock park if that's what you guys want
Do you have time to check it out
Damn and I was hoping Mark would wear his Hillrod wig
Sounds like imbreedville to me but let's give it a try
I can not meet this afternoon email me any materials to look over and questions that you have
I need to hitch a ride on that bus also
Bitching is what I do so I will continue to bitch
Thought you might find this funny
I know of several analysts currently looking for rotations
If you know of anyone in your group currently looking please let me know
Would you be interested in golf on Sat
Don't take it personnal it's just the way it is
Who dare try to come to my yard next
What is the name of the boarding place you use
Here are the positions that you requested from John
You can book my flight from Houston with everyone else
Sorry for the pain of having to wait on me
I need final signoffs on the Futures and Options practice exercises/graphics
I need help developing the graphic for this question
They suggested that I could contact you for further insight
Do you have the penultimate position for the Canadian book
Did you find out anything on my expense check
It is showing that it has been approved
Let me know if you don't
So I have two questions
Anjoli you can call Dutch Quigley and he can help you out
What should we bring
I am glad to hear that the move went well
Hi Dutch-- How are you doing
I am learning a lot
In that time you may do whatever you like
Smiling at each other they ran toward a stand of trees and dove behind a couple of bushes
I called and spoke with the manager over accounting
I can still add the cash expense
Just tell me how much it was
I will put it on there
Attached you will find the file with the volumes
I have an answer for this problem but I was just curous as to see where you would start
I'll have to research it more
Anyways thanks again for your help. by the way what is going on with the stock price
The picnic is a on its way
Attached you will find the volumes for your NYMEX bid
If anyone needs another copy of either the memo or the applications Blair and I have copies for distribution
I don't keep close watch of each and everyone's time
That is in the sense that I know how much vacation each of you has left this year
I can print reports so you can keep up with it but I don't police everyone's time that closely
Just wanted everyone to know so if you loose some vacation it will be your fault
Let me know when you want another printout before year end
As I mentioned this morning Maureen Palmer also has copies
Yes I already have a call into her
Bill and Maria one of you should check with Cindy first to make sure she is ok with it
Thanks Maria Pavlou I think Cindy is fine
What do you think about replacing him with Cindy Olsen
We would appreciate your thoughts
If not I'll probably need the help of one of you in contacting Jeff McMahon
Why wouldn't we just use Andy's replacement
I spoke with Mary Kay and told her about this concern
I'll work with Frazier to see if we can identify someone
Drew do you want to contact McMahon's office or should I
Yes I would start with Michael
Let me know if I can help on anything else
Do you know where I can get that information
I have never heard of these swaps
I don't know when these were implemented
Presumably after we signed the original deal although I don't know
Apparently the people on our trading desk dealt with the customer without getting legal input
Deborah we need to paper the swaps outlined in the attachment and get to the customer for execution
If this volume is incorrect we need to unwind the deal in RGS immediately
Jennifer pls see my slightly enhanced file attached
I need an Effective Date for the contract
Can you please verify that the pricings are correct as we have nothing to verify these against
Thanks for all of your help on this
I haven't received it yet that I can recall
Bill here's the electronic version you requested
Look under my general file in the j drive
Attached is a red-lined version of the Burlington OBA which reflects the change that we discussed this morning
I think I can help
Let me know if I can help follow up
Let me know--thanks
Bill The information you were looking for
The amendment that I think you're referring to was not signed
We sent it to Starwood and then nothing happened
If you can't reach Rell his assistant Birdie Cortinas can probably help
Do you recall the one I am talking about
Did it ever get signed
Please note that our response to Data Request No
We could attempt to summarize this other bids but I think the better approach is to just provide copies
Sorry I meant to copy you on this originally
Please let me know if this looks ok to you
First I hope your son's ok His health is obviously the top priority
Just let me know when it's convenient
I hope we are not planning on meeting for several hours
Also where are we meeting
Works for me also
I think your summary is very good
There is no certainty when dealing with a bankrupt entity however this is where we are today
The theme I keep hearing is business as usual
Actually I recommended that we attach the entire bids and not the summaries
I visited with Charlie Graham this AM
Charlie the following are contacts we have used in the past for Midland
Jerry we should probably visit about this on the outage call this afternoon
So just about any time is good for me
Anyway I just wanted to let you know that I really enjoyed meeting you and talking with you
So I hope you find the person you're looking for
Take care and best wishes for you and your family
I will be out of the office on Monday when the responses must be filed
So I would appreciate the opportunity to review the responses sometime today
Thanks for sending them to me
Attached is a red-lined version of the EOG interconnect agreement which reflects some minor changes that I made
Please call me if you'd like to discuss the attachment
I hope your new job is treating you well
Related to the above if we are obliged are we limited in the rate we can charge
These questions came up when RAC looked at our summary documentation
I am hoping these are quick questions for you
Mark Great to hear from you
And how are you doing
As you've probably heard they haven't been able to raise any money and now plan to liquidate
Again it's really good to hear from you
Been thinking of you a lot lately
I wanted to send you something via US mail
Can you send them along
Tony and I will participate in tomorrow's meeting
There is absolutely no pride of authorship on my part so please don't hesitate to comment
I would appreciate any input that you have
I should have included you on the distribution list
Therefore I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon tomorrow
At one point we considered using a bill management agreement for Consolidated Container
I worked on this with Erin Stus
If you can't find it there give Erin a call
Please let me know if you have any additional comments
Bill attached are a few comments/questions on your proposed draft answer which I thought was excellent
I think this is now ready to file except that we will need to fill in the blanks
I apologize that the attachment is not red-lined
Attached is a revised version of our response to the CPUC
I can't get that function to work on my computer
Bill attached is a third draft which contains the revisions we just discussed
Let me know tomorrow if it is acceptable as well as whether TW wants to cc the Commissioners
If this looks ok please let me know and we'll finalize and file it today
I got it shortly after I came to this department
Bill Are you the original owner of that laptop or is it a redeployed sysem
Also will we receive any confirmation of receipt of the electronic filing from FERC
Instead we process the request and generate a transportation agreement that we send to the shipper for execution
When we receive an executed transportation agreement from the shipper we countersign it and begin service
Yes although it's no big deal to leave it in
Over the past few months we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance
In response to that feedback we have provided results separately for several of our business units
In addition information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services
This quarter they are reported separately
Last week we announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural
Laine could you add Jay to your email distribution list
That is the best I can come up with right now
If the front slows down or speeds up then of course it will greatly change the forecast
I hope I did not wake you up this morning
I could not go back to sleep this morning
I have been feeling sick all morning
I have had a few people test the system
No I have bought nothing
Have you bought anything lately
If you don't know ask Mike to be sure
What is your current title
Please let me know as soon as you get a chance
This was sent to me
I don't know who wrote it but it is good
One thing struck me during the campaign that difficult roller-coaster campaign that now seems years ago
At times his staff seemed overconfident as did many of us
Then they counted the votes miscounted others and re-counted still others
At the end he was still there
You see it is this faith business that confounded everyone
God has a way of honoring those who honor him
Job learned that after his time of horrible tribulation
He actually loves those who hate him
It is a staggering concept so foreign in daily occurrence that few thought it anything but grandstanding
Appointing his enemies to high places in his government
Didn't look too good did he
The weight of the world was on his shoulders and the responsibility of a generation was on his soul
In this marriage you indeed got two for the price of one
I for one broke down innumerable times merely listening on tape delay on the radio
Then came the defining moment of our generation
Some people fondly recall their Woodstock days
It wasn't so much his words though read a decade later they will indeed be as stirring as any
It was as if God's hand which had guided him through that sliver-thin election now rested fully on him
As he walked back to his seat the camera angle was appropriate
He was virtually alone in the scene alone in that massive place of God just him and the Lord
But that's the way it's always been in his life recently
I am with you always
And you can do this well because I am going before you
I've got it
Thank you Lord
You have to do this on your own
Plus we are going to go over your Canadian Fundamentals packet
Here is your timely notice
Please check it out let me know if there is anything else
I fixed the deals
I don't have hotmail
I think we should kill the deal on the firelogs
I need to call that lady back what should I say
Do you know who Colin Tonks is
Hi...here is a test message for you
Let me know what I did wrong please
I will try to be there
It looks like there are a few outliers on the graphs but overall it looks really good
Go ahead and do whatever else you think you should do
Let me know what you think about the regression
When will it be placed in production
Please test the changes at your earliest convenient
Is this doable from your end
I got everything hooked up I guess
I think I am ok if I want to stay
I have not talked to you since your wonderful phone call
Really try to enjoy it
I have already done that
Take care and I will try to keep you posted
Dad seemed to enjoy it -- walking off the sq footage inspecting the construction etc
Carole told me yesterday afternoon that you left
I guess I know now what that was about
Anyway I wish the best of luck to you in your future endeavors
That is just my opinion but you should get what you want for them
However I am open to any and all ideas -- I want to get them something they will enjoy
If you don't have time to respond please forward this to Jennifer
As for my situation my morning sickness seems to be getting a little better
Also in the last week I have really started to pop out -- it looks and feels bizarre
Do you want to bid this for December
I am sorry...I don't know what to do
What do you mean you don't know what to do
I do not have permission to view this site
Jeff loves his job and is doing well
I was surprised that Jeff Royed left but am not shocked
Monopoly may be a little too much for her still
Should we call PG&E or do you want someone on your desk to make the call
Hope you get leied
Without the above form we cannot process your account
Should you require further assistance please contact our Customer Service Dept
I started the banter on the bottom
You don't have to apologize I'm a pretty curious person myself
What time do you typically get off work
And where do you live
Hey Cooper Well I don't know if you remember but I'm heading out to Portland for an interview
Do you think you could send it to me
I'm going to ask Nordy to send it to you
I hope you don't mind
I feel like it's more my responsibility than yours
Instead of splitting the money between us
I hope work is going well and that your feeling better
We have delayed our trip to France AGAIN
I'm in the process of building the ultimate server myself
Hope you had a good time and got all caught on rest relaxation and visiting
Let me know if we can catch a coffee sometime
Should we go right after hockey
I appreciate the look on this and am interested
Hey Cooper So are you getting ready for yoga tonight
I'm really looking foward to it
So we all sat outside waiting
So I got nothing accomplished
Can you tell me where the Space is again
She has her car here so if you need a ride let me know
I have to warn you...Jaimie is a brutal driver
I have been to lululemon in Vancouver
Have you bought anything from there
When should we leave to walk over
Hope you are having a good start to the year
To complete your registration and/or mailing list sign-up we need to verify your e-mail address
After spending that long opening a bank account I would have settled for stashing my money under my matress
I keep forgetting your American
Your not a shitty american as long as you don't believe we live in igloos your fine
Meeting at they Y sounds like a good idea
Are you still doing Yoga
If Enron sells the trading operations what will you do then

Chrissy would llliiiikkkkeeee you

I'm not sure it's your style
I will have fries and a coke with that please
Sunday it is then
I already know what I'm going to have
It was really great to see you on Saturday
What have you been doing with yourself
Cooper Trust you had a good holiday season and will be returning to this fine country soon
I can decide last minute
Are there any issues surrounding paying them
Hello and how are you
Did you say shopping
My eyes lit up as I read it accross the screen
I made some progress on the X-mas list on Friday but still have some to go
Cooper I had spelled your name wrong in my first email
Have you been down to Fernieyet
Here are your login details for GFInet Enspace
I may already have it but I'm not sure especially about the AlbertaGas database
I looked at the raw data and the unregulated portion is stupidly small
In any case give me a call when you get this and we'll talk
Called you for Burger Inn yesterday
In order to gather the information required to develop the procedure would you please answer the following questions
E-mail is my sole consolation
So what do I do you ask
What exactly do you do over there
Where did you get eze from
I'm sure she loves it
What time were you thinking of coming down for drinks
No I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down
Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke
I hear he sits right by you at work
You'll have to tell him I say hi
Anyway I should probably think about working
Do you want a look
I'd give them to you but I need a pair myself and I'm cheap
I suggest some sort of sale whereby we both win
What do you say bitch
Looking forward to seeing you over the holidays
What size are your shoes
Chrissy said she can give me a boost
I will still buy you BI
I should have let it run longer
My jeep is out front of my apt
Would you consider giving me a boost

He took it upon himself to take his shirt off
I've never seen her before but she was very mellow
I was so relaxed after the class it was just what I needed
I have been super busy and kind of stressed out lately so this was just what I needed
I would like to go to core again

Steph & I are hoping to go riding on Sunday
Hey how you doing
Are you in the office today I have a question for you
Can you send me the Star Trek vs South Park clip
I lost it
Can you point me in the right direction for this
I'm still technically a U.S employee and my visa expires soon so I really don't have any idea
Thank you very much Cooper
I appreciate that immensely and you probably don't know exactly how much that means to me
Do you have a cell phone number I could use if it ever came to that
What happens to you if things pan out that way
Are you able to change jobs up here or is your work visa void if Enron Canada goes under
I would gladly do the same for you
Todd please work with Cooper and advise me before end of business of your finds
Well if Cooper or his group over there have any personal/desktop instances I don't look after them
Are there SQL Servers you do not look after
Seems like we get jerked from pillar to post complements Houston
Just talk to Steiner if you want to hear frustration
Anyway if we can do anything to help just let me know
How should we test this
Can you please add this to our site
Just bring your appetite
OK I have a question for the group
Any gotchas I should look for
Any books/websites I should go to
See you tomorrow hopefully
I'll see if I can track it down tonight
Did you drive in to work
I presume not stunningly
This sounds good dude but you should push her a touch to see if there's any interest
Reply an hour after you get one - see what happens
Aren't you curious
I was going to see it tomorrow
Are you still alive and well
REPLY HERE AND LEAVE YOUR PHONE NUMBER or just actually call us
Jill did you see black hawk down
My Saturday night makes your Friday look like a huge shaker
I rented movies and rarely left my couch
I would go if you were going at that time
You know what Cooper don't worry about it
I'm not sure if I forwarded this or not but I'm not sure what to do with this
Please see what you can do & let me know
I told you I'm losing all my cool
I left my headlights on overnight on Sunday
This is what I sent today
Are you just getting back from the gym if so I'm impressed
Dude Can I interest you in a pair of these
Did you guess right for the free cable
She can't enter unless she knows the highly secretive codeword
I don't think she'll be able to pull it off
Dude...stuff it up your sensitive ass
I won tickets through Molson Canadian
Isn't that the one that you were talking about
You're welcome to come but my tutoring might not be much help today
Hey Jai Now that I look back at these pictures I kind of look like a loser
Hey Cooper I wanted to thank you again for asking Emily and I to the wine tasting last night
Dawn updated resume is attached - let me know if you need anything else
I may stop by ceili's on the way home but might also go home to bed
Do you have booster cables
Should I get in touch with Karen Buckley
Check her out
I know you have had a hard time keeping up to my e-mails but I don't blame you
What time is it at
Is it casual
I haven't talked to Jaimie about it yet
Funny I didn't know you could use those two words in the same sentence
I'll be more diligent in my archive search next time
Hi Chris I'm deeply concerned about all of these points and think we should meet in person to discuss
I believe Greg is setting this up shortly
Did you call Nirv yet
Speaking as a realist I don't think she's as cool as you think she is
That makes me suspicious
Regardless your advice seems sound
AND we will get another chance to stare at Sandy's body
Then after a short time I realized that there was more
Hey Cooper I hope you had a good weekend
Emmy said you guys met up after I left
Then I went home and crashed
Their sending me to this gas marketing course for three days
So I hear we're painting pottery
Are you going to come
Whatever you want to call it...it will be fun
Yes I am working at Earls this weekend
I am working Sunday night
Speaking of Earls I know how much you liked the gingerbread...but the feature dessert just changed to carrot cake
You'll have to come in and try it
I think we're going to Ceilis after work
I have some feedback w/ respect to MD apps file
Hey Cooper I don't know if I can make yoga tomorrow...I might have to work late
You can pass it along to Jai
The wine party is still on for the weekend and of course you are invited
We are all going to the Whiskey afterwards so tell everyone to meet us there afterwards
You can bring whoever you want to the wine party
I hope that isn't getting to personal...but come on you can tell me we're friends
I promise I won't say anything
Please advise when you receive it
Also I'd appreciate a one line answer to 'how's it going
Yes we were discussing your lending habits and everyone was calling me a fricken mouch
Not much new around here - John Craig keeps us laughing
Where is God's plan in reflected in my son
Scott said it was fun
I wish you much happiness and a very bright future
Ignore my comment about being a one day deal
Hopefully I can help with additional information
How was your lunch with Dan
I hope you had fun
When do you want to start
Love you and take care of yourself
Yesterday was better for me
Thanks so much - your the best
Sorry I did not realize these options were connected
One of your kids was born on a pool table
Your toilet paper has page numbers on it
I was told you may be the person to help me
Are you the person who can help me accomplish this
When do they start back to school
I so enjoy the summer when the traffic is lighter
What will we do with all these teenagers & ANDREW
Love you & take care of yourself
At the end of the night drop them off at the wrong house
It's like a full time job and we should treat it like one
There should be severance pay and before they leave you they should have to find you a temp
I said 'Mom they weren't trying to teach you how to swim
I just want to say to the authors of that study Duh
I could be eating a slow learner
At least they can find Kuwait
I never would've thought of that
They say you look fat in those uniforms
When I die I want to die like my grandfather who died peacefully in his sleep
Not screaming like all the passengers in his car
Drop me a line if you get a chance
I don't think I ever had it
Don't imagine you can change a man unless he's in diapers
What do you do if your boyfriend walks out
If they put a man on the moon they should be able to put them all up there
Never let your man's mind wander it's too little to be out alone
You might as well they never mature anyway
Men are all the same they just have different faces so that you can tell them apart
Women don't make fools of men most of them are the do it yourself types
If you want a committed man look in a mental hospital
If he asks what sort of books you're interested in tell him checkbooks
What are you thinking about
Do you love me
Do I look fat
Do you think she is prettier than me
What would you do if I died
How fat you are
How much prettier she is than you
How I would spend the insurance money if you died
Would it make you feel better if I said yes
That depends on what you mean by love
I wouldn't call you fat but you're not exactly thin
A little extra weight looks good on you
Could you repeat the question
Yes but you have a better personality
Not as pretty as you were when you were her age
Woman Would you get married again
Don't you like being married
Man Of course I do
Woman Then why wouldn't you remarry
Man Where else would we sleep
Woman Would you put away my pictures and replace them with pictures of her
Woman And would you let her use my golf clubs
You guessed it
Some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed
Upon arriving home he looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle
After finishing the cigarette he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while seated
His wife who was in the kitchen heard the loud explosion and her husband screaming
He fell down the remaining stairs and broke his arm
Until that moment he had been happily listening to his Walkman
Forgetting it was the bomb he opened it and was blown to bits
Now your day's not so bad is it.......
So he offered him freedom as long as he could answer a very difficult question
Since it was better than death however he accepted the monarchs proposition to have an answer by year's end
In all he spoke with everyone but no one could give him a satisfactory answer
What most people did tell him was to consult the old witch as only she would know the answer
The price would be high since the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged
And so it went
The neighboring monarch spared Arthur's life and granted him total freedom
The old witch put her worst manners on display
She ate with her hands belched and passed gas and made everyone uncomfortable as ever
The wedding night approached Gawain steeling himself for a horrific night entered the bedroom
The most beautiful woman he'd ever seen lay before him
What would you do
What Gawain chose follows below but don't read until you've made your own choice
Noble Gawain replied that he would let her choose for herself
The moral is that it doesn't matter if your woman is pretty or ugly smart or dumb
Underneath it all she's still a witch
Dick & I are still here
I guess we will be here for awhile
Then we get to start on the backyard and patio
I hope you can find a place to do ceramics
I still display them proudly on the appropriate holiday
Are you going home for Easter
I am not looking forward to it
Sorry it took so long to write
I knew it
Gently she closed the door and crept out of her >house
Have you had a chance to review these spreadsheets
The woman thought about this but decided she had to have the bird = anyway
I'm easy - any night works for me
Please let me know - thanks
I still do not see this adjustment in Unify
The waitress comes over and asks them what they would like
Now I see that you like all politicians were lying
I'm sorry I ever voted for you
At the table she turned to their six-year-old daughter and said Would you like to say the blessing
A mother was teaching her three-year-old The Lord's Prayer
For several evenings at bedtime the child repeated it after the mother
Suddenly something fell out of the Bible and he picked it up and looked at it?closely
Finally his big sister had enough
A father was reading Bible stories to his young son
Another three-year-old put his shoes on by himself
For several evenings at bedtime,the child repeated it after the mother
Suddenly something fell out of the Bible and he picked it up and looked at itclosely
They're the onlyfeet I got!
Embarrassed the little boy dropped his head
His grandmother knelt down next to him
I will let you know when I get a response
Frominside they heard a gentleman with a Pakistani accent say,You foreigners
The husband after much badgering from his wife finally conceded totry them on
So the idea is to convince these guys you're not worth it
Now you've seen their face and could identify them in a lineup you lose appeal as a target
Again they are looking for an EASY target
Of course the things we always hear still apply
Please forward this to any woman you know it's simple stuff that could save her life
Any feedback you have would be great
Thank you for all of you help comments or suggestons
Not long ago and far away Santa was getting ready for his annual trip...but there were problems everywhere
And that my friend is how the little angel came to be on top of the Christmas tree
I gave his resume to Scott Neal
It looks like his backround includes more origination experience than trading
Believe me it is not because I haven't thought of you
I am putting it in the interoffice mail this morning
Hope you have a good time and Nebraska wins
I am so happy you are back at Enron

I have not told the kids or Bob
I wish something= would happen good or bad
Something we have thought about for a long time
We have no time frame for him
Hope everything is = going well for you and your family
It's been a tough couple of= months hasn't it
Are you guys ok job wise
Read each sentence slowly and think about it
Don't cry over anyone who won't cry over you
You can only go as far as you push
The hardest thing to do is watch the one you love love somebody else
Don't let the past hold you back you're missing the good stuff
Some people make the world SPECIAL just by being in it
BEST FRIENDS are the siblings God forgot to give us
Good friends are like stars...You don't always see them but you know they are always there
You never know who is falling in love with your smile
Nobody is perfect until you fall in love with them
Most people walk in and out of your life but only friends leave footprints in your heart
AWESOME PRAYER May today there be peace within you
Tuesday is fine for dinner - looking forward to it
It looks like UBS Warburg is our new owner

I will work with you on this regarding renewable energy

Has Enron Wind told you they wanted to change SCs
Both Natalia and you look like very proud and happy parents
If we assume them we have to have green to serve
Further we need to know what the revenue is against this purchase to make a call on the economics
Richard - Do you have the Patagonia Contract
If we are comfortable that we are not I think we can reject
Thoughts/comments so we can proceed
Attached you will find two agreements EES has with ENRON Wind
Mike wanted me to forward this message to you both
I enjoyed visiting with you at lunch
Enron as we once knew it is not the same without you
It was GREAT to see you today
I really enjoyed catching up
Andy and I plan to attend
I do not know if they were ever paid by EESI

I was going to leave but I just found out that Laura's in Houston
No nobody harasses me so I am not going
I think somebody is harassing you
I will be here
Have fun and save me some of that cake
Hey do you have to go to the harrassment avoidance seminar
About the third time I read your email I understood it
I had no clue what you were talking about
Before Jaime Hector and I moved out of Austin I used to hang out with all these people
Harry does not particularly like them but Ramiro was also part of this group
Hmmm what should I say
Should I say I was waiting for his call all weekend long or just tell him the truth
Yeahh I want to try your King cake
I am not hungry at all though
I am not sure what happened last time they ordered
The worst part is that I ate one
At least that is what I think so I am keeping myself busy
I have time to check my e-mail though so keep writing
For example you can lie to me about how beautiful Lake Charles is oopsss
I think Jeff enjoys harassing you very very much
Anyways if you find something interesting to tell me let me know
I have King cake down here if you want some
Alejandra was asking me if I had dinner last night
I told her about our cooking experience
Don't worry I told her it was good
I hate Canada
I'll see you Monday
I think she feels priviledged
Please include him on all emails
Apparently she thought Valentines was like a first date
Now she knows we've been dating since December
Binh Knows...she quizzed me as soon as I sat down
Let me know if you have any destination suggestions
Everyone's asked me how the happy hour was last night
PS Have you decided where we're going for lunch
I'm just glad you sent it to the right person
I am so happy for you guys
I usually am right
Why would they want me at that meeting
I'm glad you made it back somewhat safely
I now have whip lash and a headache
We were lucky to make it here alive
Laura and I spoke Tuesday
She was going to contact HR and get back to me
Robin Did you get everything worked out with Laura Just checking on the status
Here's what I need to happen

Hope you guys have fun
Tell me something interesting...I'm bored

Everyone and their brother harrassed me yesterday
I don't work for him and I have more important things to do
Happy Valentine's Day to you too
I could be like my mom...she's less romantic than me
What was she sentenced for
Anyway if you can't make it please let me know
If it helps mine's not much better
I've been harrassed by at least half the company I think
Does this seem scary to you
Apparently everyone's lost their mind today
Hope your day gets better
And it has a huge stereo system in the back
If you were a snake would you bite someone with an exercise stick
Is that so it can read in bed
Are you going to be able to leave anytime soon
If you are I'll give you a ride
Well I'm not exactly busy but I do have a couple of things I could do
What did she say
Second when can we expect to be reporting positions in this book
I look forward to your responses
I'm just waiting for them to get back to me
I definitely won't leave without saying goodbye
Talk to ya later...Enjoy your day off
Don't run out of here without saying bye to me OK
What date are you planning on starting up there
Let me know if you see any problems but they seem to be in line with what you expected
I also made the changes you suggested
Please test the file at your first convenience
Here's the extent of what I know about Chicago
Hi I just spoke with Laura
She said she was going to try to call you today she is in transit back to Chicago
She apologized for the delay but things were worse than expected with her son
You would have fun if you come
Becky always tells stories about either her family or her husbands
Let me know if you change your mind
That was too weird...great minds think alike I guess
I think our emails must have crossed in the server
Someone delivered an envelope for you
I put it in your top right desk drawer
Someone just called with work for me to do so I'll talk to ya later
And yes you are really invited
Guess what I found out this morning
I'm going home...can you believe it
Give me a call when you get out of here
But I haven't given up yet
I'll let you know if I hear something
Yes I did get an apartment
If you could recommend a hotel I'd appreciate it
I will let you know as soon as I find out
Did you find an apartment
Let me know if this doesn't answer your question
Wei I appreciate your help
Please give this a looksy and let me know
Nilay Thanks for your help any ideas on why would be helpful
So tell me something
Jeff is probably wondering why he pays me today
I really don't have anything to do though
Coffee Sounds good...I'm falling asleep in my chair
Can you go now
Well...Did you find out anything
No I'm not trying to kill you
I'm not as dedicated as you are
Well if you finish the benchmark early you know where to go but don't worry
I won't be expecting you
I will talk to the MD after lunch I guess
I'll let you know what the outcome was
I am educating myself by reading some things about Acquisitions
In fact I won't make the GMAT class either
Rock officially resigned yesterday which means there's no way they'll let him back in the building
At least until I can get Binh comfortable running it
I am including the book id post id and position from yesterday
I hear your boss revoked your eating privileges
Yeah give me a call
I'll tell you all about it later
Do you have French tonight
Which means that the prices should be comparable so I'll probably try to sell it here first
I'll have to tell you that story later
In other words decide how much is the minimum you would accept for your car
Another thing I would do is check the prices in Chicago
SInce you don't have to sell it I would check the market very very well
You don't need the money and you don't need to sell it
If you decide to advertise it don't mention anything about Chicago
I'll help you with research later
I can't believe Zach ran the car into the house
It's from Becky and it sounds just like her
We'll do it again sometime
Did you find out anything else about going to Chicago
Keep me updated
Later JoAnne Hey yourself Glad you've gotten to work and have gotten settled
Emily is enrolled here-can you believe it
Seems like you had one a few weeks ago yourself
Hope it was a good one
Is he having to drive far to get to work
Guess I better get some of this junk rounded up
Maybe he'll let us go a few minutes early
Of course both were being sold by dealers so I probably couldn't get quite that much
Is there any hope of me knowing something today
Good b/c I didn't really feel like going anyway
Ok ok don't worry I won't feel bad if you don't go to Spanish
I have moved to another job
Please add Bilal Bajwa to your distribution list
Meet me downstairs
Are you ready to leave right now
Are you going to be here much longer
Let me know if you want a ride
What are you still doing here
I think all my family has their own teeth
Even my grandparents have their own teeth
You know I always thought I had good family stories but you definitely outrank me there
If they had used good or even fair hygiene then they could still have their real teeth
Now that you have picked yourself up off of the floor stop laughing
Do you have a family story to top this one
The timing is not critical for our purposes
If you need anything after Thursday please contact Binh Pham
I have enjoyed working with you both
I AM important around here
I am definitely up for lunch
If that's not good just give me a time
But I do have plans
I could probably do Friday though
I have been in Houston since the first of the year
It's a long drive but we really like it there
Of course I remember you...I'm not that much of a flake
How long have you been back in Houston
Do you have lunch plans for today
In case you forgot we worked together at LA Tech for Becky
I am back permanently now as a tax analyst
I thought maybe we could get together sometime go to lunch and chat
I would love to hear from you
It was killing me
Tomorrow's good for me
How's it going being back at work
The same file that you sent last month is fine
This is what our income should be
I hadn't thought about that scenerio yet
And they brought flowers for the tables
I think it might be tortilla soup
Actually I just found out we're taking Crystal out to eat since tomorrow's her last day
I wouldn't want to be in that meeting
I'm hungry but that's about the most exciting thing I have to tell you
Here's all my trip information
Robin Here is your information
I did not realize I needed to do this every night
When can we expect to get these books off the list
I keep offocializing but they keep showing up on the list
Can you please provide postids for the the books
I will be in class today but please communicate with Burton regarding the status of these books
I'm writing procedures for what I do...ya wanna come help me
Several of us are going to lunch today
You're invited if you want to come
Let me know if you want to come
I think everyone just assumes the balloon came from the group
Shannon forwarded me your last email
Just know that I'm thinking about you guys
I'm glad to hear you got to go running
How's your knee doing by the way
I'm still spending most of my days answering stupid questions
Some people just drive me nuts
They come freaking out telling me something's wrong
You wanna hear the latest breaking news in my career
She might have if she'd quit blowing off our lunch plans
I'm not sure what I think about living somewhere that cold
I'm not sure I even have clothes to go for the interview much less to live up there
Has Shannon told you about the guy I'm seeing
He didn't exactly make the best first impression on her
He really is smart no matter what she tells you
Then he came home with me for Thanksgiving but we were still just friends then
No one's said anything yet but I know there are plenty of rumors going around
I'd love to hear from you if you have time
If not I understand
What's he doing now
I just surfing the web to see what I can find out about Chicago so my schedule's pretty flexible
So I take it your having a bad day
Don't let him stress you out
Let me know if you want anything from downstairs
No one's asked the questions I was expecting
I think Anne was too drunk to remember asking
Are you still planning to go work out at lunch
I told Gabriel about your hairdryer story
A little birdie told me today was your birthday
Anyway I wanted to wish you a very Happy Birthday
Are you sure about that email address
I sent one and it bounced...or was that just another test
The only error message I got was 'OPT_CLASS_CD INVALID'
I can't help you with that issue but you also mentioned you were having problems loading your spreadsheets
I might be able to help you with that one
No you can't keep it
Just let me know when you finish
I'm in no hurry so take your time
I know I whine when I'm too busy but frankly I'm having trouble thinking of things to do today
Is your boss freaking out today
I just got a call from AA so I guess that'll keep me busy for a while
Let me know if you want to join me
It wasn't just me changing plans
And of course get my car aligned Sat
So just call me at home when you get home
How did you get back to your desk that fast
How's you day going
Did you come in early today
It looks like this was never done in your report
I thought it had been based on previous Emails
Remember the p&l we are reporting by trader excludes originations
Here a quick summation of my morning...CANADA SUCKS
And here my favorite
I wonder if that is painful
I imagine not
I can drive
So what ever you want
I was thinking Churassco's but I'm definitely open to suggestions
If you have any questions or you are no longer responsible for updating the origination schedule please call me
I love biiiiigggg breakfasts in NIICE restaurants
What is up with me in this group
They are definitely going to fire me
When we were discussing about all these things I decided to stretch my leg and guess what
Yeahh we missed some of the conversation
I thought it was funny but obviously he did not think so
Oohhh you know what
I actually work Monday
My boss decided to veto our holiday Monday
I couldn't schedule my car appointment for Sat
So I had to schedule it for Monday and you'll love this
Robin I have to get this email out and I'm looking for your help
Just let me know when you want to go
But give me a few minutes we're working on something
I don't think I can handle Treebeards so I was thinking of going to Subway
Actually I have no plans but I'm very willing to get away from my desk for a little while
Unless you want to do it I'd give it to her
Anything interesting in your world
I may come visit you before I go to my class
That is if you aren't too busy today
You're still worried that I'm mad aren't you
I'll call you when things settle down here today
The tone of your email frankly did not help matters
FYI I'm not avoiding returning your call
Yeah you are way too excitable in the mornings
I get dizzy just reading your emails
I'm on my way home
Looks like there might be hope of me leaving sometime tonight
I'll page you before I leave
I come back and he is doing the same thing
I'll call when I get home
That is if I get home at a decent time
Please complete the below information and forward to me ASAP
We're never going to get to eat are we
I'll let you know when Jeff gets back
What time do you want to go and you'd better start thinking
I leave it up to you
